PT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3   PTT 25.5 total protein was 6.2   albumin 3.4   globulin of 2.8   calcium of 9.1   phos 2.7   mag 2.1   urea 3.7 . ALT was elevated at 240   AST 85   LDH 305   alk phos 85   total bilirubin was 1.3   direct bili was .8 . Cholesterol 188   triglyceride was 127 . UA  trace protein   trace ketones   positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1 bacteria . Chest x-ray  Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia . In summary   the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA   status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever   four days of diarrhea   nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall . The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea . When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics . So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl   which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her . Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy   which the patient declined . She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done . Another major issue with this patient was pain control . She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion . So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking   so we tried different things for pain management . One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 . After that the patient had minimal relief of pain . However   she declined further blocks   which were offered to her . So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up . She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch . She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours . We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain . Other things that happened during this admission  we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status   which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking . We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions . In addition her liver transaminases were elevated   we thought about doing further work-up   but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that . That has been stable . The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic . Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 . A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH . We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia  we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium  we stopped it . We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction . In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped   so that now at the time of discharge   the patient &aposs sodium is between 126 and 129  prior to that it had gone down to as low 116. So that has really improved . We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day . On the 14th of January   the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &aposs hump . Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE . So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin   we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s. Her INR is 2.3 . We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 . So if it goes much lower than 2   then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night . However   we would leave it at 2.5 for now . Other major issues  As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems   her blood pressure was elevated also . We put her on nifedipine IR   SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic   so we had started her on atenolol . So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 . If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure . The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities   so I think that fluid restriction should help with that . She is also a little dry . The patient is on oxygen . Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen . She was on 4 liters  now she is on 5 liters   sating 94 to 96 on 5 liters . We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well . The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia   pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure . ,1,2

177, BY SYSTEM 1. PULMONARY  She was treated with albuterol and Atrovent continuous nebulizers and was weaned then to intermittent nebulizer treatments and then to her meter-dosed inhalers taking them q.4h. at the time of discharge . She was continued on salmeterol and Flovent . She was continued on Solu-Medrol 80 mg q.8h. then converted to prednisone at 60 mg p.o. q.d. She was started on Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d. Serial arterial blood gases were followed after an arterial line was placed . Her PCO2 gradually declined to the 48 range . Despite episodes of somnolence the first night which were presumably due to having spent the entire night in the Emergency Department   she never became more hypercarbic   and her PCO2 trended to 48 by the time the arterial line was discontinued . On the night of admission and thereafter   she was noted to have a very stridorous sounding breathing when the patient was asleep . This would disappear whenever she was awake . Her case was discussed with Ear  Nose  Throat and the Medical Intensive Care Unit attending . She was given a trial of 80  20 mixed helium  oxygen to decrease the stridor but had minimal effect . Ear  Nose  Throat recommended not considering this an airway problem unless she was stridorous while awake . The patient was to arrange for Pulmonary and Medicine followup through her primary care physician upon discharge as she has not been seen in the Pulmonary Clinic in two years . 2. CARDIOVASCULAR  The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial creatine kinases   although these did rise to 816 . MB was negative . She was treated with captopril for hypertension   and this was switched to Norvasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. on discharge . She had an echocardiogram which showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular of normal thickness and size   and no significant valvular disease . She apparently did not have a cardiovascular component to her wheezing or shortness of breath  however   she was to go home on Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. to help with lower extremity edema   as she experiences discomfort with this   and the team felt this may be a limiting factor with her prednisone compliance . 3. ENDOCRINE  She was treated with a sliding-scale of regular insulin while she was in house . She was given 500 mg p.o. q.d. of metformin to treat her steroid-induced diabetes on discharge . This should be followed up by her primary care physician . 4. INFECTIOUS DISEASE  She was treated briefly with levofloxacin because of the gram-positive cocci in her sputum culture  however   her symptoms were felt to be consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection   and levofloxacin was continued at the time of discharge . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. Combivent meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h. weaning to albuterol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h. Salmeterol 2 puffs q.12h. Flovent 220 mcg 2 puffs q.12h. Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q.d. with taper . Fentress 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d. Univasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. Metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE STATUS  Discharge services included visiting nursing which was to assess in her inhaler technique   monitor her fasting blood sugars   as well as her blood pressure   monitor her peak flows   and assess her mobility and activities of daily living at home . DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP She was also to seek the next available appointment with Dr. Jeanette Barr or to see another resident in the Saint Vincent Hospital Clinic if she cannot get an appointment within one week .

154, 1  Cardiovascular  The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction . She remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time . The patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities . The patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix . The patient &aposs Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm . The patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia . At this time   the patient &aposs presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology . 2  Neurological    vascular  The discrepancy in the patient &aposs pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis . The patient underwent MRI    MRA of the head   neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis   proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery . The left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon . The patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA . MRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct . The patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease . The patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally . The results of these studies suggested that the patient &aposs symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon   and therefore   it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and    or surgical or percutaneous intervention . A Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient &aposs intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure . 3  Orthopedic The patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event . Outside hip films were obtained   but were not available for view . Repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture   likely new . An Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance . A bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative . At the time of this dictation   the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of Physical Therapy and a walker .Plan,0,2

 Of note  Na 133   K 4   WBC 8.82   hematocrit 35.1   platelets 229 . PT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3   PTT 25.5 total protein was 6.2   albumin 3.4   globulin of 2.8   calcium of 9.1   phos 2.7   mag 2.1   urea 3.7 . ALT was elevated at 240   AST 85   LDH 305   alk phos 85   total bilirubin was 1.3   direct bili was .8 . Cholesterol 188   triglyceride was 127 . UA  trace protein   trace ketones   positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1 bacteria . Chest x-ray  Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia . In summary   the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA   status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever   four days of diarrhea   nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall . The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea . When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics . So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl   which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her . Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy   which the patient declined . She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done . Another major issue with this patient was pain control . She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion . So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking   so we tried different things for pain management . One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 . After that the patient had minimal relief of pain . However   she declined further blocks   which were offered to her . So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up . She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch . She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours . We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain . Other things that happened during this admission  we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status   which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking . We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions . In addition her liver transaminases were elevated   we thought about doing further work-up   but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that . That has been stable . The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic . Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 . A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH . We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia  we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium  we stopped it . We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction . In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped   so that now at the time of discharge   the patient &aposs sodium is between 126 and 129  prior to that it had gone down to as low 116. So that has really improved . We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day . On the 14th of January   the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &aposs hump . Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE . So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin   we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s. Her INR is 2.3 . We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 . So if it goes much lower than 2   then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night . However   we would leave it at 2.5 for now . Other major issues  As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems   her blood pressure was elevated also . We put her on nifedipine IR   SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic   so we had started her on atenolol . So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 . If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure . The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities   so I think that fluid restriction should help with that . She is also a little dry . The patient is on oxygen . Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen . She was on 4 liters  now she is on 5 liters   sating 94 to 96 on 5 liters . We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well . The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia   pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure . ,1,2

 Cardiac arrest  His arrest was of unknown etiology at the time of admission . No further history was ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his hospitalization . CT angiogram had been negative for pulmonary embolism . The patient had an echocardiogram on 2013-04-26   which showed a normal ejection fraction and trivial mitral regurgitation  otherwise no obvious abnormalities were seen . Given the patient had an out of hospital arrest   remained unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability   he was treated with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body temperature to 32 degrees Celsius for a period of twelve hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent six hours . This was done   however   as in problem number two below   we were not successful in any neurologic recovery . Neurology  The patient remained unresponsive after the induced hypothermia   the patient was noticed to develop myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids . Electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing persistent seizure activity . Neurology was consulted and the patient was treated very aggressively   loaded with multiple drugs   including Ativan and Propofol drips . The patient continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this . He was loaded with Dilantin and ultimately was treated with a Pentobarb coma . After multiple attempts of weaning the Pentobarb   the patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was never able to be suppressed . Infectious disease  Over the course of his hospital stay   the patient s white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17 . Multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately found to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia   pneumonia   and urinary tract infection . For all these infections   the patient was treated with Vancomycin and he was also on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission . Blood cultures cleared by 2013-05-03 . Sputum culture as late as 2013-05-10   however was still positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus . The patient remained gravely ill throughout his hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his family with his son being his next of kin . Ultimately it was decided that the patient s wishes would be to not be maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only . With these goals of care   the patient expired on 2013-05-11 . The family did consent to a postmortem examination . DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES  Cardiac arrest .

Colitis . The patient has a history of ischemic bowel status post SMA Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty with recent admission for gram negative rod urosepsis complicated by C. difficile colitis . The patient received a full course of Flagyl and was C. difficile toxin negative times three prior to transfer . He now returns with fever   rising white count   diarrhea   and dehydration . Initially treated with intravenous ceftizoxime   gentamicin   and Flagyl for presumed sepsis   either with urine or bowel source . He was also started on p.o. Vancomycin . Blood cultures and urine cultures came back negative . Stool for C. difficile returned positive . The diagnosis   therefore   was relapsed C. difficile colitis . Intravenous antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was continued on p.o. Vancomycin . He improved clinically with defervescence   decreased white blood cell count to 10 000 with resolution of left shift   and some decrease in abdominal distention on exam . An abdominal CAT scan revealed thickened bowel wall and thumb printing   primarily involving the cecum and right colon greater than the left   consistent with C. difficile colitis . The diagnosis of recurrent bowel ischemia   however   was not ruled out and this will continue to be a concern in the future . The patient was initially n.p.o. and was then advanced to clear liquids which he tolerated . He will be advanced to soft solids prior to discharge . 2. Azotemia . The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.8-2 . Creatinine had risen to 4.3 on admission presumed secondary to sepsis and dehydration . With intravenous hydration the BUN and creatinine fell to 12  1.9 which is within normal limits for this patient . The abdominal CAT scan showed no evidence of hydronephrosis orrenal abscess . 3.

 On admission   includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing . Hematocrit 39 percent   white blood cell count 4500   PT and PTT normal . Sodium 140   potassium 4.2   chloride 105   carbon dioxide 30   BUN 24   creatinine 1.0 . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory . There   her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44  17 . Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex . She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction . Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch . The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded . The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded . The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis   but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery . This was considered her culprit lesion . This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft . In addition   it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs . Her left internal mammary artery was also unused . It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead . She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing . This was intermittent . The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed . The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker . It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure . Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately . She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time . When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker   she had significant angina . Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable . The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft . He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction . For this reason   it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates . The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service . On August 20   under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm.   which permitted appropriate atrial sensing . There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads . It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode . She tolerated this well . Her medications were resumed . She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase   KS .

 1. cerebrovascular accident . The patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery . This was determined by head CT   head MRI   head MRA   carotid noninvasive studies   transcranial Dopplers . The possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor . Her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function   a patent foramen ovale   with a trace right to left shunt   as determined by bubble study   trace MR was present . Previous echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital . Her Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT   but was otherwise unremarkable . The patient had a normal B12   negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization . She was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started . Her exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point   however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day . Her pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge . She needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight   5  22  92 . In addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour . It is discontinued at the time of transport . The patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete . During evaluation of her neurologic status   it was determined that for several months prior to admission   the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate . On our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia   especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown . There are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen . At the time we were to embark on this evaluation   the patient &aposs family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital . What follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia . Her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function   though this is not certain . Moreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions . Our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome   relating to her history of breast Ca . As I mentioned above   her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time . While mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal   the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head . Two possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody . These tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge . The results can be obtained by paging me   Do A. Joasscchird   M.D. at 834-364-2251 . I will be happy to furnish the results . The patient has a history of MI in 1989 . Echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities . EKG   when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q  wave inversion . We would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension   but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this . Persantine thallium is scheduled at this time   but is yet to be performed . The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years . It has been evaluated in the past without success . During her hospitalization   we confirmed the presence of this   even when she was hydrated with saline   to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2 . Studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia . Studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal . This is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk . Florinef is to be considered   however stopping the Isordil is one goal . The patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia . In addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection . This has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray . CT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings . A chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding . A PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday   4 26th . The left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa . The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990   for which she received 6 months of Coumadin . Dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission . It is doubtful that she has chronic PE   but this is one consideration . It is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease   and so this is a consideration . The patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 . We think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic . This can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time . The patient has glaucoma . Her medications are as listed below . Her ophthalmologist is aware of transfer . His name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033   b 549 .

 BY SYSTEM  Respiratory  The baby was intubated in the Delivery Room   received two doses of surfactant . Radiograph revealed bilateral diffuse granular pattern consistent with surfactant deficiency . Maximum mechanical ventilation PIP 26   PEEP 6   rate of 25   maximum FIO2 35 percent . Mychelia was extubated to a CPAP of 6 cm on day of life two where she remained until day of life 20 . On day of life two   she was also loaded with caffeine and continues on caffeine at time of transfer . She was transitioned to a nasal cannula on day of life 20 and remains on nasal cannula O2 100 percent at 13 cc flow . She averaged 2-3 apnea episodes a day with bradycardia and desaturations . She has a comfortable respiratory rate and good air exchange . Cardiovascular  She received a normal saline bolus times one initially for poor perfusion and was started on dopamine with a maximum infusion rate of 6 mcg per kg per hour . This was discontinued on day of life two to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 33 . She has remained hemodynamically stable during the remainder of her hospitalization here . Fluids   electrolytes   nutrition  Initially maintained NPO . UAC and UVC lines were placed upon admission to the CMED . The UAC was left in place until day of life two and was removed after wean from dopamine . UVC remained in place through day of life six and was utilized to administer parenteral nutrition . Electrolytes and glucose remained in the normal range throughout the first week . She was started on enteral feeds on day of life six with a slow advance secondary to increased abdominal girth which was felt to be due to CPAP . She passed meconium . She achieved full feeds on day of life 13 . Calories were gradually increased to breast milk 30 calories with ProMod consisting of four of human milk fortifier   four of MCT and two of Polycose with a 12-28 teaspoon of ProMod per 50 ml of breast milk or 60 ml of formula . On day of life six due to concerns for hyperglycemia and abdominal distention   sepsis evaluation was obtained . She was noted at this time to have hyperglycemia requiring two subcutaneous doses of insulin and a decreased glucose infusion rate to achieve euglycemia . This resolved that same day . Urine output was always noted to be of sufficient quantity . Gastrointestinal  Mychelia demonstrated slow gastrointestinal motility and abdominal distention felt to be due to CPAP . She was slow to advance on enteral feeds and gradually attained full enteral volume on day of life 13 . On day of life 15   she was made NPO for a distended abdomen and a bilious spit . Serial KUBs revealed nonspecific changes with dilated loops . No pneumatosis or free air was seen . She was noted to have bluish discoloration thought to perhaps be a bruise on her left lower quadrant . There was no radiographic correlation with this . Feeds were restarted . Again   she was advanced to full volume but was made NPO on day of life 20 for abdominal distention . This NPO was temporary for that day and she then resumed feedings and has been tolerating full enteral feeds well   improved since off of CPAP   passing normal stools   guaiac negative . Mychelia was also treated for physiologic jaundice . She was started under phototherapy on day of life one through day of life three with a peak serum bilirubin of 4.7  0.3 . This issue resolved . Hematologic and Infectious Disease  Initial CBC was notable for a white count of 5.5 with 49 polys   1 band and 47 lymphs . Initial hematocrit was 46.3 percent and platelets 320 000 . Her initial blood culture remained negative and she received 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamicin . As previously noted on day of life six with hyperglycemia   abdominal distention   a CBC and blood culture were again obtained revealing a white count of 9.1 with 30 polys   0 bands and 58 lymphs . Hematocrit at that time was noted to be 31 and platelets 370 000 . Blood culture grew staph coagulase negative and the baby received seven days of vancomycin and gentamicin . A lumbar puncture was also performed to rule out meningitis . This culture remained negative with normal cell counts and chemistries . Antibiotic levels were monitored and doses adjusted accordingly . Mychelia required two transfusions during her hospital stay . On day of life 15 for a hematocrit of 29   she received 20 cc of packed red blood cells . She started on iron and vitamin E supplements on day of life 25 and continues on that at this time of transfer . However   on day of life 34   12-04   she was noted to be pale and less stress tolerant   mottling easily with care . A hematocrit and reticulocyte count showed a hematocrit of 23 percent and a reticulocyte count of 1.9 percent . Therefore   with blood available from the first aliquot   a second 20 cc per kg of packed red blood cells were infused without incident . Neurological  Initial head ultrasound on day of life seven was normal . At one month of age   on 12-03   she was noted to have an absent septum pellucidum . An MRI obtained and reviewed by the Hallmark Health System Radiology Department revealed focal gyral morphology consistent with prematurity   normal midline structures   normal myelination   no lesions   no signal abnormalities or extracerebral collections . The cortical ribbon is intact . The major vascular structures at the skull base are normal . The septal leaflets may be partially absent   but there are no coronal images provided for confirmation and the pituitary stalk is present . An Ophthalmology consult was obtained to determine the presence of optic nerves . These were both determined to be present and intact . Endocrine was also consulted . Several labs were ordered . Electrolytes and thyroid studies were noted to be in the normal range with serum sodium of 136   potassium 4.7   chloride 98 and CO2 34 . She had a calcium of 10.3   a phosphorus of 4.8 and alkaline phosphatase of 440 . Thyroid function studies revealed a TSH of 2.2   T4 of 5.7   T3 of 101 and a cortisol level of 43   all within the normal range . A growth hormone was sent and the results were pending at time of transfer . In addition   an FSH and LH were obtained on 12-10 and results are pending at time of transfer . Please contact lab control at Mattapan Community Health Center for results   409  238-8236 .

 BY SYSTEM  1. NEUROLOGY  Mr. Roach was transported to Intensive Care Unit from the trauma bay . Upon arrival   Neurosurgery promptly placed V. Holtzen bolt . This allowed continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure . Notably   intracranial pressure was 17 when the bolt was placed . During his hospitalization   his intracranial pressure was monitored very closely and maintained to a level of less than 20 . To do this   mannitol 25 mg q. 6h. was used . While using mannitol   his serum osmolalities were followed closely . In addition   to monitoring his intracranial pressure   his systemic blood pressures were maintained in such a manner that his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg . A parameter monitor for his neurologic status PaCO2 which was maintained between 35 and 40 during his hospitalization . Mr. Roach was kept sedated with propofol and was given Fentanyl and    or morphine boluses for pain . Neurologic checks were followed initially every one hour and then every two hours to monitor for change in neurologic examination . During his hospitalization   two subsequent CAT scans were obtained  one on hospital day two . This CAT scan revealed possible worsening and was read as epidural versus subdural bleed . After a discussion with both Radiology and Neurosurgery   the decision was made that the worsening did not appear significant   and this was not accompanied by a change in his clinical condition . His intracranial pressure remained stable   and his clinical examination was unchanged . An additional CT scan was obtained on hospital day three . This examination was unchanged from the previous examination . Again   his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same   and conservative treatment was opted for . CARDIOVASCULAR  As described in previous section   Neo-Synephrine and eventually Levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than 70 . A pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four . This catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support . Please see Infectious Disease section for more details . 3. GASTROINTESTINAL  Mr. Roach was n.p.o. from the time of his admission . A orogastric tube was passed . Initially during admission   carafate was given down the orogastric tube . However   on a routine chest x-ray shot on hospital day three   a mediastinum was noted . This raised the question of potential esophageal rupture . Gastroenterology was consulted for this . Gastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status . At this point   his carafate was switched to intravenous Protonix and he was strictly n.p.o. 4. HEMATOLOGY  Throughout Mr. Richard admission   his hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s . As will be discussed in the Infectious Disease section   he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis   and his white blood cell count peaked at 23 . Mr. Roach was on Pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis . He was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage . An inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred   as it was felt that Mr. Roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure . 5. ENDOCRINE  Mr. Marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from 100 to 130 using a regular insulin sliding-scale . 6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE  Mr. Roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers . His blood urine and sputum were all cultured . Blood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram  positive coagulase  negative Staphylococcus which grew from 08-25 . His preliminary cultures including sputum from 08-25 grew Escherichia coli . Sputum from 08-27 grew gram-negative rods   not yet speciated   and from 08-27 a bronchoalveolar lavage grew 1 gram-negative rods and 4 polymorphonuclear lymphocytes . Throughout this time   Mr. Richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four   his temperature maximum was 42.2 degrees centigrade . During his hospitalization   his was treated with vancomycin for his gram-negative rods   imipenem   and Flagyl . Initially   he had been placed on clindamycin to cover his drain   but his cultures became positive   and his white blood cell count increased . He was switched from clindamycin to the imipenem and Flagyl . Vancomycin was added when we had the positive blood culture . With a fever of 102   up to 42 degrees centigrade   aggressive measures including cooling blankets   alcohol swabs   and fans were used in an attempt to bring his body temperature down . Hypercarbia would result and increase in cerebral perfusion   paralysis was initiated to decrease genesis of carbon dioxide secreted during shivering . 7. PULMONARY  As discussed in the Infectious Disease section   Mr. Roach developed a pneumonia likely from gram-negative organisms   but most likely from Escherichia coli . For this pneumonia   he was placed empirically on imipenem   vancomycin   and Flagyl . On hospital day three   Mr. Roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea . For this   a CT angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism . On hospital day four   a routine chest x-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax . For this   a left 34 Caucasian chest tube was placed . On the evening of hospital day four   Mr. Roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole . Urgent resuscitation measures were initiated . The measures included attempts at pacing . Epinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium . He had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax   cardiac tamponade   and pulmonary embolism . During the resuscitation afterwards   it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest   so initially neo-decompression was attempted in the right chest . There was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression   and a right chest tube was placed . During this time   a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back . A left anterior thoracotomy was made by the Cardiac Surgery fellow who was present . After 30 minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage   there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors . Resuscitation was terminated at 1914 on 08-27 . After the termination of resuscitation   both the anesthesia Intensive Care Unit attending and the surgical attending were present to discuss the proceedings events with the patient s family members including his next of kin   his mother . Permission for a postmortem examination was granted . Matthew M. Barnett   M.D. 78 -102 Dictated By  Mark D.

 A Neurosurgery consultation was obtained   and it was their impression that the patient &aposs paraplegia might possibly represent a cord concussion   and recommended treatment with intravenous steroids for 24 hours . The patient &aposs paraplegia resolved by the morning of her second hospital day   and she maintained 5  5 motor strength in all groups . A Urology consultation was obtained   and it was recommended that an IVP be obtained . This was obtained on the day of discharge   however   due to residual contrast in the colon from the patient &aposs prior abdominal CT scan the exam was postponed after a scout film was obtained . The patient fell well on the day of discharge . She remained afebrile throughout her hospital course . Additionally on the night before discharge   flexion and extension views of the lumbosacral spine were obtained   and showed no fracture or instability . DISPOSITION  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  Good .,0,2
 BY SYSTEM 1. PULMONARY  She was treated with albuterol and Atrovent continuous nebulizers and was weaned then to intermittent nebulizer treatments and then to her meter-dosed inhalers taking them q.4h. at the time of discharge . She was continued on salmeterol and Flovent . She was continued on Solu-Medrol 80 mg q.8h. then converted to prednisone at 60 mg p.o. q.d. She was started on Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d. Serial arterial blood gases were followed after an arterial line was placed . Her PCO2 gradually declined to the 48 range . Despite episodes of somnolence the first night which were presumably due to having spent the entire night in the Emergency Department   she never became more hypercarbic   and her PCO2 trended to 48 by the time the arterial line was discontinued . On the night of admission and thereafter   she was noted to have a very stridorous sounding breathing when the patient was asleep . This would disappear whenever she was awake . Her case was discussed with Ear  Nose  Throat and the Medical Intensive Care Unit attending . She was given a trial of 80  20 mixed helium  oxygen to decrease the stridor but had minimal effect . Ear  Nose  Throat recommended not considering this an airway problem unless she was stridorous while awake . The patient was to arrange for Pulmonary and Medicine followup through her primary care physician upon discharge as she has not been seen in the Pulmonary Clinic in two years . 2. CARDIOVASCULAR  The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial creatine kinases   although these did rise to 816 . MB was negative . She was treated with captopril for hypertension   and this was switched to Norvasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. on discharge . She had an echocardiogram which showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular of normal thickness and size   and no significant valvular disease . She apparently did not have a cardiovascular component to her wheezing or shortness of breath  however   she was to go home on Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. to help with lower extremity edema   as she experiences discomfort with this   and the team felt this may be a limiting factor with her prednisone compliance . 3. ENDOCRINE  She was treated with a sliding-scale of regular insulin while she was in house . She was given 500 mg p.o. q.d. of metformin to treat her steroid-induced diabetes on discharge . This should be followed up by her primary care physician . 4. INFECTIOUS DISEASE  She was treated briefly with levofloxacin because of the gram-positive cocci in her sputum culture  however   her symptoms were felt to be consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection   and levofloxacin was continued at the time of discharge . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. Combivent meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h. weaning to albuterol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h. Salmeterol 2 puffs q.12h.

 After consultation with Cardiology as well as Anesthesia on call that evening   it was decided to transfer the patient to the ICU for intensive monitoring . Central IV access was obtained . The patient was carefully diuresed over the next 48 hours . Symptoms of congestive heart failure gradually abated over the next 48 to 72 hours . The patient was given antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity . A Neonatology consultation was obtained during the course of the hospitalization . After discussion   it was decided to attempt to obtain 28 weeks gestation and then deliver electively by cesarean section given the decompensation in the third trimester . The patient underwent primary low transverse cesarean section on 2014-05-19 at approximately 28 weeks gestation . The cesarean section was performed on the West Campus in the Cardiothoracic Surgical Suite . This was performed in this location in case any acute cardiac decompensation occurred during the time of cesarean section . Cardiothoracic Surgery was on standby during the surgery . The patient went to the cardiac Intensive Care Unit on the West Campus postoperatively . She did well during the postoperative period . She required several episodes of diuresis due to increasing shortness of breath on postoperative day 1 and postoperative day 2 due to worsening symptoms of shortness of breath from fluid shifts that normally occur during the postpartum period . The patient was transferred to the West Campus on postoperative day 2 in stable condition .

She is referred for progressive angina . She had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing . She has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 . In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded . In October   1989   Dr. No re-did her bypass operation . She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending   saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 . In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block . She had exertional angina at that time . In November   1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis   high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft . She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis . Since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning   radiating to the left neck and arm   relieved by nitroglycerin . She was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . Because these symptoms have been increasing   particularly at cardiac rehabilitation   she was referred here . In May   1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic . She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect . She has had no syncope . Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol . She has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother   sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction . She is a remote cigarette smoker . She also has a history of lactose intolerance   peptic ulcer disease   with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages . She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .,0,0

Was discharged on 11  16  2003 in stable condition with the last recorded hematocrit of 31.3 . He was asked to continue on his Nexium   iron and vitamin C and was continued on his other home medications .,3,2
 By systems  Respiratory  Pocasset was admitted to the newborn intensive care unit with mild respiratory distress . Chest x-ray revealed a left pneumothorax which resolved on its own without intervention . The infant has remained in room air throughout her hospital course with occasional apnea and bradycardia episodes   the last being documented on 2020-01-14 . Cardiovascular  Attleboro has been stable throughout her newborn intensive care course without issue . Fluids and electrolytes  Birth weight was 1515 grams . She was initially started on 80 cc per kilo per day of D10W . Enteral feedings were initiated on day of life 1 . Full enteral feedings were achieved by day of life 7 .

Humulin Walters insulin 24 units subcutaneous q A.M. and 8 to 16 in the evening depending upon where his blood sugar has been . Preoperative laboratory values were unremarkable . The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 2011-10-17 which revealed a 20 left vein osteal lesion as well as 70 LAD lesion and an 80 right coronary . The patient was taken to the operating room on 2011-10-18 where he underwent an aortic valve replacement with 23 mm pericardial valve as well as coronary artery bypass graft times two with a LIMA to the LAD and saphenous vein to the acute marginal . Postoperatively the patient was transported to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on Milrinone   Neo-Synephrine and Levophed drip . The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and subsequently extubated on the night of surgery . He remained on Levophed   Milrinone and Neo-Synephrine drips and was hemodynamically stable . N. Saez clinic consult was obtained due to hyperglycemia and the need for insulin drip in the Intensive Care Unit . On postoperative day the Milrinone was weaned down . The Levophed had been discontinued as the Neo-Synephrine and the patient was beginning to progress hemodynamically . Upon discontinuation of the Milrinone the patient s SV02 had dropped significantly in the low 50 s. The patient had decreased exercise tolerance and therefore was placed back on his milrinone to keep his cardiac index greater than 2.0 . Over the next couple of days it was very slowly decreased as his Ace inhibitors were increased orally . The patient ultimately was weaned off the Milrinone   transitioned to Captopril on postoperative day five and remained hemodynamically stable . Once the patient had remained off of inotropics for approximately 24 hours   he had been given diuretics and Ace inhibitors and remained hemodynamically stable he was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the Telemetry floor on postoperative day six . A physical therapy evaluation was obtained for assistance and mobility . Cardiac rehabilitation was initiated at that time . On 2011-10-24 postoperative day six consultation heart failure cardiology service was obtained . It was their recommendation to continue Ace inhibitors   to continue daily weights   to switch the patient to a long acting beta-blocker and to enroll the patient in postoperative cardiac rehabilitation as well as to make sure the patient was on statin drugs . These measures were all instituted . The patient continued to progress from cardiac rehabilitation and physical therapy standpoint while on the floor . The patient remained hemodynamically stable over the next few days   continued to increase with physical therapy and ambulation . His blood sugars were followed by the Cape Cod Hospital Clinic service and insulin has been adjusted accordingly . Today   2011-10-31   postoperative day 13 the patient remains stable and ready for discharge to home .

 The patient was admitted to the Service of Dr. Fede A. Duhenile . On 1  12  92 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent a neart total gastrectomy with a retrocolic Bill-Roth II gastrojejunostomy reconstruction . In addition a small ventral hernia was noted upon abdominal exploration within a previous surgical incision . This was repaired . A needle jejunostomy catheter was placed at the time of her operation to facilitate postoperative nutrition . With regards to the cancer   there was a large mass along the greater curvature in the body of the stomach   and several perigastric lymph nodes which were taken with the specimen . In addition   there were at least two lymph nodes within the porta hepatis which were dissected free and taken en bloc with the specimen . The remainder of her abdomen was unremarkable without evidence of metastatic spread elsewhere   including the liver . The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition . The patient s postoperative course was for the most part unremarkable . Her wounds healed well without incident and the needle jejunostomy tube was utilized on the first postoperative day right up until the time of discharge   infusing Vivonex T.E.N. The patient tolerated this without difficulty . The patient s nasogastric tube was removed on the 3rd postoperative day   and with the passage of flatus and good bowel sounds noted   she was started on a liquid diet which was advanced slowly . She was seen by the dietician and was advised with regard to needing numerous small meals during the day rather than 3 larger meals as she previously was used to . Her ambulation and mobilization increased gradually and by the time of discharge she was walking in the halls without assistance . As mentioned   her wounds healed well without incident and the staples were removed on the 10th postoperative day just prior to discharge . She had some difficulties with confusion in the early postoperative period which were attributable to her advanced age and a sundowning effect . These problems resolved by the 4th or 5th postoperative day and she remained lucid and alert for the remainder of her hospital stay . Surgical pathology report was completed prior to discharge which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ulcerating and extending through the wall into the serosa of the stomach . Metastatic carcinoma was present in 3 of 3 lymph nodes . The gastric resection margins were free of carcinoma . The patient was set for discharge on the 11th postoperative day doing well . On the day prior to discharge she complained of some dysuria   a urine specimen was obtained   which showed numerous white cells consistent with a urinary tract infection . She was started empirically on Bactrim   while culture and sensitivity results were pending and remained pending at the time of this dictation . She will be discharged to home and will be seen in follow-up by her regular physicians as well as Dr. Ko .,0,2

 The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula . The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 . She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe . This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present . Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable . She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 . She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids . A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe . She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then . A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .

 The patient is a 66 year old white female with metastatic colon carcinoma with a mass in the left superhilar region   who presents for bronchoscopy   mediastinal exploration and resection . The patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced the onset of abdominal pain in early 1992 . In December of 1992   she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon carcinoma which was Duke &aposs grade B-II   lymph nodes were negative . She received postoperative chemotherapy . In September of 1992   she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan . The exploratory laparotomy was negative . She continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up . In September of 1993   an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993   she had a negative bone scan . In December of 1994   a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region   adjacent to the aortopulmonary window . She also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months   which was due to left vocal cord paralysis .

 The patient was afebrile   heart rate 73   blood pressure 158  53   respiratory rate 16-20   oxygen saturation 97 on three liters . General  The patient was somnolent   breathing comfortably   occasionally coughing . Neck was supple with full range of motion . No bruits were heard . Chest was clear to auscultation but with poor air entry . Heart sounds were regular with one out of six holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . Abdomen was soft   non-tender   bowel sounds present . Extremities were without clubbing   cyanosis or edema . Neurological examination revealed a patient who was intermittently alert   opening eyes to voice   following simple commands   but without any speech . Pupils were 4 mm reactive to 2 mm bilaterally . There was no pupillary defect . Dolls eye was negative . There was a possible right gaze preference and the patient did not move his eyes . Corneals were present bilaterally . Gag was present weakly . Face was symmetrical . Tongue was midline . The patient was moving the right side spontaneously   but could not hold arm or leg up for any length of time . There was only minimal movement on the left side . On sensory testing   the patient withdrew all extremities to pain . Reflexes were 2 and symmetrical all over . The left toe was upgoing   the right toe was downgoing . LABORATORY  Laboratory data revealed a sodium of 139   potassium 3.4   chloride 101   bicarbonate 28   BUN 11   creatinine 1.2   glucose 151 . AST was 20   ALT 12   alkaline phosphatase 80   bilirubin 0.5. CK was 113 . Thyroid function tests were normal . Troponin I was 0.05 .

 The patient is a 50-year-old female with history of low back pain radiating to both legs . She had increasing symptoms overtime   not controlled by conservative management . She therefore elected to undergo surgical treatment . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Her past medical history is notable for bilateral lower extremity venous insufficiency with edema   hypertension . She takes lisinopril    hydrochlorothiazide 20  25 mg p.o. q.d.   Vioxx 50 mg p.o. q.d.   Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.   Nortriptyline 25 mg p.o. q.h.s.   Neurontin 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.,0,0
 BY SYSTEM 1. PULMONARY  She was treated with albuterol and Atrovent continuous nebulizers and was weaned then to intermittent nebulizer treatments and then to her meter-dosed inhalers taking them q.4h. at the time of discharge . She was continued on salmeterol and Flovent . She was continued on Solu-Medrol 80 mg q.8h. then converted to prednisone at 60 mg p.o. q.d. She was started on Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d. Serial arterial blood gases were followed after an arterial line was placed . Her PCO2 gradually declined to the 48 range . Despite episodes of somnolence the first night which were presumably due to having spent the entire night in the Emergency Department   she never became more hypercarbic   and her PCO2 trended to 48 by the time the arterial line was discontinued . On the night of admission and thereafter   she was noted to have a very stridorous sounding breathing when the patient was asleep . This would disappear whenever she was awake . Her case was discussed with Ear  Nose  Throat and the Medical Intensive Care Unit attending . She was given a trial of 80  20 mixed helium  oxygen to decrease the stridor but had minimal effect . Ear  Nose  Throat recommended not considering this an airway problem unless she was stridorous while awake . The patient was to arrange for Pulmonary and Medicine followup through her primary care physician upon discharge as she has not been seen in the Pulmonary Clinic in two years . 2. CARDIOVASCULAR  The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial creatine kinases   although these did rise to 816 . MB was negative . She was treated with captopril for hypertension   and this was switched to Norvasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. on discharge . She had an echocardiogram which showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular of normal thickness and size   and no significant valvular disease . She apparently did not have a cardiovascular component to her wheezing or shortness of breath  however   she was to go home on Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. to help with lower extremity edema   as she experiences discomfort with this   and the team felt this may be a limiting factor with her prednisone compliance . 3. ENDOCRINE  She was treated with a sliding-scale of regular insulin while she was in house . She was given 500 mg p.o. q.d. of metformin to treat her steroid-induced diabetes on discharge . This should be followed up by her primary care physician . 4. INFECTIOUS DISEASE  She was treated briefly with levofloxacin because of the gram-positive cocci in her sputum culture  however   her symptoms were felt to be consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection   and levofloxacin was continued at the time of discharge . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. Combivent meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h. weaning to albuterol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h. Salmeterol 2 puffs q.12h. Flovent 220 mcg 2 puffs q.12h. Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q.d. with taper . Fentress 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d. Univasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. Metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d. Dyazide was discontinued . DISCHARGE STATUS  Discharge services included visiting nursing which was to assess in her inhaler technique   monitor her fasting blood sugars   as well as her blood pressure   monitor her peak flows   and assess her mobility and activities of daily living at home . DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP She was also to seek the next available appointment with Dr. Jeanette Barr or to see another resident in the Saint Vincent Hospital Clinic if she cannot get an appointment within one week .

 Vital signs  Blood pressure 140  80   heart rate 86 . She is a pleasant   obese   black female in no apparent distress . There is no lymphadenopathy . Her skin is intact without lesions . Her HEENT examination is benign . Her neck is slightly tender with a firm thyroid   but no masses or bruits . Her lungs have decreased sounds bilaterally in the upper lung fields . Her heart is regular rate and rhythm . She has a well healed umbilical hernia scar for approximately 2 1  2 cm . She has no clubbing   cyanosis or edema on her extremities . LABORATORY  Pulmonary function tests on September 27   1997 revealed an FVC of 2.7 which is 112 and FEV1 of 2.23 which is 123 . Her admission laboratory data includes serum chemistries with a sodium of 144   potassium 4.1   chloride 101   bicarbonate 28   BUN 10   creatinine 0.9 and glucose of 93 . White blood cell count is 7.65   hematocrit of 42 and platelets of 345 . Her urinalysis shows 2 bacteria and 2 squamous epithelium with greater than 10 000 mixed bacteria . Chest x-ray on August 6   1997 revealed multiple pulmonary nodules increased in size as previously mentioned . PT was 11.7   PTT 26.7 and INR of 0.9 .,1,2
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol . He was treated with aspirin   heparin   and intravenous nitroglycerin . No beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110  70 . The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9 MB fraction . This was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes . on 10-27-93   the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions   a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA &aposd   a lesion in the first OM   and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 . The left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle . Given the results of this cardiac catheterization   which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA   it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient . He was ambulated progressively on the floor . A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid . The patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath . On 11-2-93   the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging . This treadmill test was done on medications   including beta blockers   in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment . The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol   however   he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade . There were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test   although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II   III   and AVF . The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain . Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle . There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test . These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 . After extensive discussion between myself   Dr. Amesin   and Dr. Scgach   it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management . The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery   although he understands that this may become necessary in the future . Dr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient &aposs daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient &aposs compliance . Previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments . The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient . She will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside . The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization . Despite being on heparin for a short time   his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done . He will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future . CAGHALA UINTEELE   M.D. TR  yf    bmot DD  11-3-93 TD  11  04  93 CC,0,0

 Patient is a 28 year old gravida IV   para 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion . Patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in 02  90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at Vanor . Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion . Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively   she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin . On ultrasound in 02  91   the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination . She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy . Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions . The patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough . She was evaluated by Dr. Mielke   a Pulmonologist   who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 . She was admitted to Weekscook University Medical Center with a diagnosis of possible asthma . Room air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56   a pCO2 of 35   and a pH of 7.52 . EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion   a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted   and no evidence of tamponade . Given the patient &aposs history of cervical cancer   the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant . She was therefore transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further care .,0,0
 The patient was started on ceftazidime   nafcillin and Flagyl for concern of a soft tissue infection . Neutropenic precautions were taken . The patient had a bone marrow biopsy which showed myeloid arrest and probable neutropenia from a drug-related cause presumed to be the sulfasalazine . Over the course of the hospitalization   the patient &aposs white blood cell count rose from 0.4 to 6.3 after he was given G-CSF   a course lasting from 9  28  01 until 9  30  01 . After the G-CSF   the absolute neutrophil count was greater than 8000 . On 10  3  01   the patient had a repeat head and neck CT   which showed a right parotitis and left submandibular lymphadenopathy with some necrosis . No frank abscesses . The patient &aposs antibiotics were changed to clindamycin 300 mg q.i.d. and patient was also put on sialagogue . Over the course of the hospitalization   the swelling and tenderness and erythema have steadily decreased . Recommendations on antibiotics were made by infectious disease team   who was consulted . Rheumatology was also consulted for patient and after workup   it was believed that arthritis may be a rheumatoid factor negative   rheumatoid polyarthritis . Rheumatology recommended a taper of his prednisone to 20 mg q.d. and the patient will be followed by the rheumatology service . The oncology service was also consulted for patient and performed a bone marrow biopsy . Throughout his course during this hospitalization   the patient was also followed by the ENT service . The ENT physicians did not recommend any procedures   incision and drainage for his right parotitis or left submandibular cervical lymph node necrosis . The ENT team recommended watching patient in-house for two days after his repeat imaging on 10  3  01   and to continue antibiotic coverage with clindamycin . The patient had no positive blood cultures during his hospitalization and remained afebrile after the second day of admission .,0,0

 The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital   on the Neurological Surgery Service of Lupevickette L. Ca   M.D. Prior to his admission   the patient &aposs gunshot wound was sutured close in the emergency room . The patient was placed on suicide precautions   and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid . The patient was seen in consultation by the Psychiatry Service   who began a battery of testing   which continues at the time of discharge . The Consulting Psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times   and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter . Allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended . From a medical standpoint   the patient did well . He was initially admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization . The chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of Captopril and Nifedipine . After his blood pressure had stabilized   the patient was transferred to the Neurology Ward . Close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen . The Psychiatry Service followed up extensively with the patient   and his Psychiatric progress is detailed in the Psychiatry transfer note . By the 7th hospital day   the patient was medically stable . He had undergone full Psychiatric evaluation   and was prepared for transfer to a Psychiatric Hospital . Therefore   because of his need for intense psychiatric care   the patient is discharged to the Vo Black Doylestrictshore Ft. Clinics Medical Center on the 7th hospital day .

 Patient &aposs hospital course is as follows  Patient is an 84-year-old male who was transferred from an outside hospital with a low hematocrit of 21 and with guaiac-positive stool . The day prior to admission   he experienced dyspnea on exertion   and on the day of admission he collapsed and complained of substantial weakness . He denied any melana   any hematemesis   nausea or vomiting . He was taken to an outside hospital at the time at which time it was found that his hematocrit was 21   blood pressure 90  60   and his INR was 3.3 . Of note   he is anti-coagulated for an artificial heart valve . He was at that point given 1 unit of packed red blood cells . On further questioning   the patient reported that he started to feel &quot different &quot several days ago with slowing and difficult ambulation progressing to complete inability to ambulate . He was also short of breath with ambulation   but he does have baseline shortness of breath with exertion . He denied any chest pain   dysuria   loss of consciousness   fevers   chills or any history of myocardial infarction . Patient was last admitted to Padrugmoff Hospital with a hematocrit of 24.5   and was asymptomatic prior to admission . At that time   he had guaiac-positive and had a small bowel follow through which was negative . He was transfused 4 units during that admission and discharged with a hematocrit of 34 on vitamin C and iron sulfate . EXAM ON ARRIVAL IN THE LO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM  On arrival at the Lo Hospital Emergency Room  He was found to have a temperature of 97.4   heart rate 65   pressure 107  52   respiratory rate 22 and saturating 100 on 2 L of a nasal cannula .

 Mr. Vessels is a 49-year-old man status post orthotopic heart transplantation in 1991 at Dautenorwe Stuart Erec Hillpa Of Hospital who is admitted with dyspnea and severe heart failure . Mr. Vessels &aposs postoperative course has been marked by CMV infection   hypertension   poorly controlled lipids   peripheral vascular disease   and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 or so . Recently he had documented coronary angiography based on a catheterization performed in January 1996 with moderate to diffuse atherosclerosis . A repeat angiogram performed a year later showed marked progression of coronary allograft disease . A biopsy at that time revealed grade 1B rejection with endothelialitis and eosinophils . He was treated with pulsed IV steroids and Imuran   was augmented with mycophenolate Mofetil . Chest x-ray showed cariogenic pulmonary edema and he was faring poorly . Prior to admission he was seen approximately 1 week in the office with mild congestive heart failure . An echocardiogram then revealed an ejection fraction of 40 and an endomyocardial biopsy revealed no ejection .,2,2
 The patient was admitted to Urology . After the wound was further opened   he was started on ampicillin   Gentamicin   and Flagyl antibiotics and he was placed on a bid dressing change and packing . On hospital day 2   the patient had no complaints . He was afebrile with stable vital signs and good urine output . The wound erythema was improving and the wound was packed twice a day . Wound cultures remained negative at that time . We continued his ampicillin   Gentamicin   and Flagyl . By hospital day 4   he remained afebrile throughout his hospital course . The wound cultures demonstrated gram-positive cocci in clusters and gram-negative rods . Blood cultures remained negative . The patient was continued on antibiotics and we obtained a CT scan to check for an enterocutaneous fistula . We discontinued his Flagyl on that day . We contacted the patient &aposs primary care physician   Dr. Aslinke   regarding his cardiac medication management . We agreed that he should resume his atenolol . He was started on 2.5 mg PO qd . He was continued on his dressing changes . We changed the dressings tid instead of bid for continued drainage .

 The patient was admitted with a right occipital cerebral infarction . The patient was started on intravenous heparin and had the studies as described above for rule out source of embolic strokes including carotid noninvasives   transcranial Dopplers   Holter electrocardiogram and echocardiogram . The patient also had serial electrocardiogram   which showed no change . The patient also had serial creatinine kinase with MB fractions studied   which revealed MB fraction too low to be tested . The patient also experienced a feeling of moving back and forth when lying down with neck extended during the magnetic resonance imaging study and also in bed . This moving sense   with normal electroencephalogram   was thought to be a mild vestibular dysfunction or from the acute episode of the stroke . The patient will have these symptoms only when the eyes are closed . Our opinion was not to intervene or have any further studies for acute period and to continued to observe . The patient did have a hypotensive episode and the systolic blood pressure was 80   after the patient received his regular cardiac medications . The patient had been off his regular medications since during the admission and will be discharged off his medications . Otherwise   there were no further episodes of blurred vision . The patient was stable with an unchanged neurological and physical examination and was discharged on aspirin 325 mg po qd   on May 14   1995 .

 Cardiac arrest  His arrest was of unknown etiology at the time of admission . No further history was ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his hospitalization . CT angiogram had been negative for pulmonary embolism . The patient had an echocardiogram on 2013-04-26   which showed a normal ejection fraction and trivial mitral regurgitation  otherwise no obvious abnormalities were seen . Given the patient had an out of hospital arrest   remained unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability   he was treated with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body temperature to 32 degrees Celsius for a period of twelve hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent six hours . This was done   however   as in problem number two below   we were not successful in any neurologic recovery . Neurology  The patient remained unresponsive after the induced hypothermia   the patient was noticed to develop myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids . Electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing persistent seizure activity . Neurology was consulted and the patient was treated very aggressively   loaded with multiple drugs   including Ativan and Propofol drips . The patient continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this . He was loaded with Dilantin and ultimately was treated with a Pentobarb coma . After multiple attempts of weaning the Pentobarb   the patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was never able to be suppressed . Infectious disease  Over the course of his hospital stay   the patient s white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17 . Multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately found to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia   pneumonia   and urinary tract infection . For all these infections   the patient was treated with Vancomycin and he was also on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission . Blood cultures cleared by 2013-05-03 . Sputum culture as late as 2013-05-10   however was still positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus . The patient remained gravely ill throughout his hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his family with his son being his next of kin . Ultimately it was decided that the patient s wishes would be to not be maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only . With these goals of care   the patient expired on 2013-05-11 . The family did consent to a postmortem examination . DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES  Cardiac arrest .

 Of note  Na 133   K 4   WBC 8.82   hematocrit 35.1   platelets 229 . PT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3   PTT 25.5 total protein was 6.2   albumin 3.4   globulin of 2.8   calcium of 9.1   phos 2.7   mag 2.1   urea 3.7 . ALT was elevated at 240   AST 85   LDH 305   alk phos 85   total bilirubin was 1.3   direct bili was .8 . Cholesterol 188   triglyceride was 127 . UA  trace protein   trace ketones   positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1 bacteria . Chest x-ray  Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia . In summary   the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA   status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever   four days of diarrhea   nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall . The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea . When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics . So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl   which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her . Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy   which the patient declined . She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done . Another major issue with this patient was pain control . She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion . So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking   so we tried different things for pain management . One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 . After that the patient had minimal relief of pain . However   she declined further blocks   which were offered to her . So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up . She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch . She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours . We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain . Other things that happened during this admission  we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status   which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking . We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions . In addition her liver transaminases were elevated   we thought about doing further work-up   but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that . That has been stable . The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic . Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 . A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH . We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia  we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium  we stopped it . We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction . In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped   so that now at the time of discharge   the patient &aposs sodium is between 126 and 129  prior to that it had gone down to as low 116. So that has really improved . We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day . On the 14th of January   the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &aposs hump . Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE . So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin   we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s. Her INR is 2.3 . We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 . So if it goes much lower than 2   then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night . However   we would leave it at 2.5 for now . Other major issues  As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems   her blood pressure was elevated also . We put her on nifedipine IR   SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic   so we had started her on atenolol . So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 . If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure . The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities   so I think that fluid restriction should help with that . She is also a little dry . The patient is on oxygen . Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen . She was on 4 liters  now she is on 5 liters   sating 94 to 96 on 5 liters . We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well . The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia   pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure . DISPOSITION  Discharge medications  Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d.   MVI one tablet p.o. q.d.   Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area   also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h   Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.   coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours   atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  Fair . She remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema . She is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care . Follow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem    Onc in two weeks . The appointment has already been made . The patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .

This is consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage   more likely hypertensive in etiology . No significant subarachnoid or intraventricular hemorrhage is appreciated . There is mass effect present with shift of the normally midline structures towards the left . There is also left sided subfalcine herniation . There is no hydrocephalus . The visualized osseous structures and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable . IMPRESSION  Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe . This most likely relates to hypertensive hemorrhage   as opposed to a ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm . Brief Hospital Course  Patient was a 75 year old right handed male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin   coronary artery disease   hyperlipidemia   dementia with sudden onset left sided weakness   dysarthria . Head CT demonstrated a large right intracerebral hemorrhage   centered around basal ganglia and putamen . We felt this was likely secondary to hypertension . While still in the emergency department   he had rapid decompensation necessitating intubation for airway protection . Examination post intubation but off intubations showed clinical evidence of elevated intracranial pressure and brainstem compression . The overall prognosis was guarded . He was admitted to the Neurology    Neurosurgery ICU . He was loaded with Mannitol and Dilantin in the emergency room . He was evaluated by the Neurosurgery service and they did not feel a surgical intervention or ventriculary drain was warranted . After arrival in the ICU   patient was followed with neuro checks every 1 hour . Sedation was held to allow for frequent exams . Head of bed was kept at 30 degrees . Labetalol continuous infusion was titrated for systolic blood pressure of 130-160 . Mannitol and Dilantin were continued . After lengthy discussion   the patient s wife opted to make him DNR on afternoon of 2013-11-11 . Overnight   fresh frozen plasma was given for goal INR of   1.4 . On serial exams by neurology and ICU attendings in the morning on 2013-11-12   patient had no clinical signs of brainstem activity . Namely   he was unresponsive . Pupils were fixed and dilated . No corneal   gag   oculocephalic   and oculovestibular reflexes were elicited . He was not overbreathing his ventilator . At this point   patient was felt to have clinical signs consistent with brain death .Plan,2,

Nexk CT  Increased soft tissues within the pharynx . This may be secondary to soft tissue swelling as indicated in the patient s history   and some may be secondary to secretions above the ETT balloon . No retropharyngeal fluid is identified . Dependent atelectasis is present within the visualized portions of the lung apices . 2. Chest CT  Bilateral lower lobe consolidations mostly in dependent portion   with small pleural effusion and diffuse ground-glass opacity in bilateral upper and lower lobes   consistent with ARDS with pulmonary edema given the history . Ground-glass opacity is somewhat more prominent in right upper lobe   and superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded . Brief Hospital Course This is a 39 year-old female with diabetes type I   hypothyroidism   gastroparesis who was transfered for hypoxic respiratory failure . 1. Hypoxic Rspiratory Failure She arrived intubated and sedated from Esteban Hospital . On arrival a chest x-ray showed perihilar and bibasilar opacities   which appeared conistent with pulmonary edema but also possibly consistent with a pneumonia . There was no evidence of ARDS . She was known to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum at the outside hospital . A bronchoscopy with BAL was performed and a sputum sample eventually grew out MRSA . She was treated with vancomycin to cover her MRSA pneumonia . A CT scan was performed on 07-17 to evaluate the soft tissue swelling seen on CT at the outside hospital . The CT showed increased soft tissues within the pharynx which was felt to be secondary to prolonged intubation    trauma . She was treated with steroids for this swelling at the outside hospital   and these were continued . It was decided that patient should receive one more trial off the vent before committing her to a tracheotomy . She did well on minimal vent settings but it was decided to delay extubating the patient until the morning of 6  2 . Overnight   the patient became hypoxic   dropping to the 80 s . A chest x-ray showed that the ET tube was displaced to very high in the trachea . The cuff was deflated and the patient was extubated . She was placed in supplemental oxygen by shovel mask and her sats immediately improved . She was weaned down until she was maintaining her oxygen saturation above 90 on 6L by nasal cannuala . As she was doing well without evidence of stridor   the steroids were stopped . She did well and was weaned from supplemental oxygen . At the time of discharge   she was oxygenating well on room air . She Will need to complete a 14 day course of vancomycin for her MRSA pneumonia on 2019-07-30 . 2. Enterobacter bacteremia  She was initially covered broadly with vancomycin   ciprofloxacin   and falgyl . She had positive blood cultures at Mediplex Rehab Hospital Hospital for gram negative rods . Subsequently   zosyn was added . The cultures grew out enterobacter cloacae . It was unclear the source of her bacteremia . Her stool cultures were negative . Her central line was removed and the tip was culture negative . She was transitioned to on levofloxacin for her bacteremia . She had no positive cultures during this admission . Once she was more stable   an abdominal CT was performed to look for an abscess . This study was negative . However   the study was limited due to inadequate po contrast intake by the patient  it did show a question of a cecal cystic lesion verse normal loop of bowel . This study will need to be repeated once she is tolerating po s . She will complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin for her bacteremia on 2019-07-30 . 3. Diabetes type I She was intially maintained on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control . She was followed by Albano during the admission . She was initially maintained on D5W   which was increased to D10W as the patient was persistently borderline hypoglycemic while on insulin drip . Once she began to take PO s   the insulin drip was stopped and patient was started on glargine with a humalog sliding scale . While her po intake was minimal she was maintained on supplemental IV dextrose to suppress ketosis . While she was on the IV dextrose   she required up to 26 units of glargine for glycemic control . As she starting taking some foods   her glargine was decrease . At the time of discharge her glargine was 10 . Her blood glucose were under good control . The day prior to discharge   she was nauseated and not taking pos . Therefore   she received 1L of D5   and her sugars were elevated to 400 the day of discharge . 4. Gastroparesis  She has a history of gastroparesis secondary to long-standing type I diabetes . Once she was extubated   she was nauseated with emesis . She was intially treated with erythromycin for pro-motility as she had a bad reaction to reglan in the past . She continued to remained nauseated so she was treated with phenergan   anzemet   zofran   and ativan . She intermittently was able tolerate pos . Her nausea was accompanied by abdominal pain for which she was treated with morphine . She was transitioned to a PCA for better pain control . She continued to have nausea despite an agressive anti-emetic regimen . It was felt that her symptoms were secondary to gastroparesis . However   other causes were looked for including adrenal insufficiency and bowel obstruction . She had a normal cortisol stimulation test . A abdominal plain film showed non-specific bowel gas patterns that may represent an early obstruction . A NG tube was placed for decompression given the signs of early obstruction the day of transfer . The GI service was consulted and they felt that her symptoms were all gastroparesis . They recommended erythromycin and zelnorm . She should eventually have a tissue transglutaminase to rule out celiac disease . 5. Transaminitis  Per report   She had elevated LFTs at the outside hospital . A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed and was negative for any acute pathology . Her LFTs trended down during this admission . 6. Hypothyroidism  She was maintained on her levothyroxine . While she was not taking adequate pos   she was on IV levothyroxine . 7. F  E  N  She was NPO while intubated and recived tube feedings for nutrition . After extubation   patient was started on sips and had a speech and swallow evaluation . She was cleared to advance her diet as tolerated . She only tolerated some clear liquids . At the time of transfer   she was NPO given her NG tube . Prophylaxis  PPI   Heparin SQ . Access  Her central line was removed given the concern for a line infection . She had a double lumen PICC place . 10. CODE  FULL 11.

There are several areas of hyperintensities at the convexity which could be intraaxial and could be related to hemorrhage within the metastatic lesions but in absence of gradient echo images   this could not be further confirmed . A CT would help for further assessment if indicated . There is increased signal seen in both basal ganglia region as well as along the rolandic region bilaterally which is suggestive of global hypoxic injury to the brain . There are several areas of brain edema identified in the left frontal and parietal lobe and both temporal lobes   which are suspicious for areas of metastatic disease with surrounding edema . There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift seen . No herniation is identified . Images through the skull base demonstrate soft tissue changes in the sphenoid sinus which could be due to retained secretions from intubation . There is increased signal seen along the sulci on FLAIR images at the convexity which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage . A CT would help for further assessment and exclude proteinaceous material within the sulci . Gadolinium-enhanced MRI would also help for further assessment . . pCXR 2016-05-11 501am FINDINGS  No prior comparisons . Tip of the ETT projects roughly 5 cm above the carina . A right IJ central venous line is at the level of the mid SVC . Tip of the NGT is below the edge of the image . IVC filter and probable NU stent catheter on the left also noted . Heart and mediastinum are unremarkable allowing for technique   no sizeable pneumothorax . There is a somewhat wedge-shaped opacity at the right lung base which could represent aspiration or pneumonia . No other confluent infiltrates are appreciated . pCXR 2016-05-11. 146pm Mild pulmonary edema . Vague right lower lobe opacity most likely represents pulmonary edema though if opacity persistent after diuresis   aspiration and pneumonia will become considerations . ETT 4 cm above the carina with NG tube advancement into the stomach . . EEG 2016-05-12 Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing . These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy . Medications   metabolic disturbances   and infection are among the most common causes . Subarachnoid hemorrhage is another possible explanation . There were no areas of prominent focal slowing   and there were no epileptiform features . Trans-thoracic echocardiogram 2016-05-12  The left atrium is normal in size . Left ventricular wall thickness   cavity size   and systolic function are normal  LVEF>55  . Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal . Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal . The aortic valve leaflets  3  appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation . The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation . There is no mitral valve prolapse . The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined . There is no pericardial effusion . IMPRESSION  Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function . No pericardial effusion . . pCXR 2016-05-13  Mild left lower perihilar opacification has improved   probably resolving edema . There is more rightward mediastinal shift   suggesting new atelectasis in the right lung . Enlargement of the right hilus could represent adenopathy . Whether to pursue this would depend upon clinical circumstances . Heart size normal . ET tube in standard placement . Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view . No appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusions . pCXR 2016-05-14 Increasing opacification of the lungs could be due to mild pulmonary edema and multiple micrometastases   worsened slightly since 05-13 at 1057 p.m. Heart size is normal . There is no pleural effusion . The ET tube and right PICC line in standard placements . Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view . No pneumothorax . .

Course complicated by sub arachnoid hemorrhages and intraparenchymal bleeds as well as potential hypotensive brain injury with poor prognosis per neurology . Transferred here for second opinion on poor prognosis . .  Neurologic  The patient was seen by the Neurology consult service and underwent MRI head which revealed lesions suspicious for metastases   possible hemorrhages   and findings consistent with hypoxic brain injury . EEG was performed and revealed encephalopathy . The patient s neurologic exam  performed after sedation removed >48 hours  revealed intact brainstem function without evidence of higher cortical activity . She had some metabolic abnormalities which were corrected  hypernatremia   hyperphosphatemia    but neurologic exam was unchanged . A family meeting on 2016-05-13 was held and these findings communicated with the patient s family . Final neurologic assessment was that the patient was unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic functioning . At the request of her family   she will be transferred closer to her home in Wyoming   to Women and Infants hospital . .  Respiratory Failure  Pt arrived on pressure support ventilation   which was changed to Assist control to make patient more comfortable . She was originally intubated for airway protection   and it is felt she could likely be weaned from the ventilator although she would be extremely high risk for aspiration . Due to family request to move patient to a hospital closer to home   she will remain intubated until transfer   with plan to extubate upon arrival to Women and Infants hospital with initiation of full palliative care and compliance of DNI status . .  Fevers  Infection  Per outside hospital records   the patient grew pseudomonas from blood and urine . At OSH   she was treated with 7 days of vancomycin   as well as 13 days  of 14-day planned course  of Ciprofloxacin and Zosyn . She was intially continued on Cipro  Zosyn . CXR 05-11 revealed ? pneumonia vs atelectasis at the R lung base . Continues to spike fever . Could have still seeding of nephrostomy tube . Urology at OSH against pulling tube because coagulopathy and may not be able to replace . Fevers also may be from head bleed   cancer   or drug . She was continued on zosyn and vancomycin to complete a >14 day course . She continued to have fevers . Antibiotics were discontinued on 05-15 . No further infectious course was identified and the fevers may have been due to underlying malignant process . .  Squamous Cell Cancer  unknown primary . The patient was seen by the oncology consult service who contacted her outside hematologist Dr. Pauling . Upon discussion with him it was noted that the patient had progression of her disease after systemic therapy with topotecan and cisplatin . She then proceed to XRT with cisplatin which she was unable to tolerate this secondary to thrombocytopenia  40-50K  . Given this we were unable to offer her additional therapy. Hematology  Oncology service at Mediplex Rehab Hospital confirmed her grim prognosis and expective survival in terms of weeks to months with no further available treatment . .  h   o DVT  patient with head bleed which is contraindication to anti-coagulation .

 Labs on admission from outside hospital   CBC notable for a white count of 21.9 with hematocrit of 36.3 and normal platelets . Chem-7 notable for potassium of 3.2 and bicarbonate of 30 . LFTs show an elevated ALT of 52 and AST of 101 with normal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin . Latest arterial blood gas with pH of 7.45   pCO2 43 and pO2 155 on 100 percent oxygen via ventilator . RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES  Chest x-ray shows right middle lobe   right lower lobe   and left lower lobe infiltrates . EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with normal axis and intervals   borderline LVH . SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE  Respiratory  On admission   the patient had what appeared to be acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to community  acquired pneumonia . She was maintained on a ventilator and ventilated according to ARDSNet protocol . For antibiotic coverage of her pneumonia   she was started on Levaquin   ceftriaxone   and vancomycin . Over the next two days after admission   the patient s vent settings were gradually weaned   and she was extubated two days after being transferred to this hospital . After extubation   the patient was oxygenating well on face mask . She did continue to have a persistent fairly severe cough  however   her cough was weak due to abdominal muscle pain from repeated coughing . The cough was mostly nonproductive . The patient was breathing comfortably . As there was no identified bacterial pathogen on any cultures   the patient was continued on the triple antibiotics for first several days of the hospitalization . She was also on round-the-clock Atrovent and albuterol nebulizers . Once the patient was transferred out of the ICU and after extubation   the antibiotics were gradually narrowed . The vancomycin and Levaquin were discontinued after approximately four days in the hospital . The ceftriaxone was discontinued after four days in the hospital   and the patient was to continue on Levaquin . The patient had gradual improvement in her oxygenation . Pain control  The patient had fairly significant abdominal pain secondary to persistent cough . She was started on a regimen of MS Contin with oxycodone for breakthrough pain . This helped her somewhat though she has continued to have difficulty coughing due to the pain . Tylenol and ibuprofen were also added for better control . Transaminitis  The patient was noted to have mild transaminitis on admission . However   this was felt to be due to her significant infection . This should continue to be followed as an outpatient to assure that it returns back to normal . Anemia  The patient s reticulocyte count showed inadequate production . Iron studies showed a mixed picture with decreased iron and decreased iron to TIBC ratio suggestive of iron-deficiency anemia   but also normal to high MCV . B12 was noted to be low and the patient was given an injection of IM B12 while in the hospital . She was also started on iron supplementation . Hypothyroidism  The patient was continued on Synthroid for her chronic hypothyroidism . DISCHARGE STATUS  The patient was discharged home with services .,1,

His UA had 10-17 white blood cells  trace leukocyte esterase hyaline casts numbering 60-70 . His chest x-ray was notable for clear lungs with no edema or infiltrates and small bilateral effusions . OTHER NOTALBE LABS  Patient was found to have a troponin of 0.71 on admission with a CK of 46 and CKMB of 3.4 . ASSESSMENT  At that time   it was felt that the patient was likely having a repeat GI bleed and while he was hemodynamically stable   he had evidently lost a substantial amount of blood . HOSPITAL COURSE  1. GI  Patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight   the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately . He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission . He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin C . His Coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding   even though it was important to keep his INR 2.5-3.5   given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the Coumadin . He was subsequently seen by the GI team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following  In the esophagus   there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum   the mucous appeared edematous . A small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding  an Endoclip was applied to this . Another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there . In the duodenum   a small AVM was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized . The biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia . Also of note   prior to the upper endoscopy   the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation . Patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge . His last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3 . His last BUN and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an INR of 2.5 . Consideration was given to performing a repeat colonoscopy . This was discussed with the GI Service who felt that this was not necessary given the recent colonoscopy that he had had in 05  2003 . 2. Cardiovascular  A  Ischemia  Patient &aposs troponin bump was found to be likely to demand ischemia in the setting of his GI bleed   it was not felt that he was having acute coronary syndrome . On discharge   he was continued on his aspirin   simvastatin and his Lopressor which was initially held   and subsequently restarted . B  Rhythm  Patient continued to be in A-fib. throughout the admission and was restarted on his Coumadin concurrently with heparin . Heparin was subsequently DCd once his INR reached a therapeutic level between 2.5-3.5 . His last reported INR on discharge was 2.5 . C  Valves  Patient had   as noted above   his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves . However   his Coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic INR levels before discharge . D Pump  Patient   during this hospital course   became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products . He was diuresed initially with one dose of Lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to Lasix . He subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state . Of note   he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission . DISPOSITION  Was discharged on 11  16  2003 in stable condition with the last recorded hematocrit of 31.3 . He was asked to continue on his Nexium   iron and vitamin C and was continued on his other home medications .,1,

 On admission   includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing . Hematocrit 39 percent   white blood cell count 4500   PT and PTT normal . Sodium 140   potassium 4.2   chloride 105   carbon dioxide 30   BUN 24   creatinine 1.0 . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory . There   her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44  17 . Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex . She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction . Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch . The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded . The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded . The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis   but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery . This was considered her culprit lesion . This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft . In addition   it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs . Her left internal mammary artery was also unused . It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead . She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing . This was intermittent . The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed . The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker . It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure . Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately . She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time . When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker   she had significant angina . Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable . The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft . He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction . For this reason   it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates . The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service . On August 20   under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm.   which permitted appropriate atrial sensing . There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads . It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode . She tolerated this well . Her medications were resumed . She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase   KS .

 Remarkable for an oriented   alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3  6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis . His pulse exam was intact . Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest   with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index . There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient   native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex   dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip . A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted   and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present . Also of note   pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix   Morphine   oxygen and nitroglycerin . Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection . He remained hemodynamically stable but of note   would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe . Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18 with global hypokinesis . The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan . The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting . In the course of preoperative workup   Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac   underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology   possibly microvascular infarct   acute paranoid and belligerent behavior   possibly due to medications . On December 12 the patient underwent surgery   including a re-do aortic valve replacement with  25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one  saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft . The total bypass time  2 hours 25 minutes . Total crossclamp time  1 hour and 48 minutes . The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one   Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride . The patient was extubated by postoperative day  1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement . Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema . Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded   albeit sluggishly . In addition   he remained agitated . This was attributed to mild hypoxia and    or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately . On day  2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix   Mannitol infusion . His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour . Despite this   his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated . He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting . He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure . Very early in the morning on postoperative day  3   the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated   without complication . With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis   his arterial blood gases improved . Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable . Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine . His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum . Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin   Ceftazidime and Gentamicin . Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient &aposs increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval . Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued . In addition   the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 . On the evening of the 18th   the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable   although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal . On 60 FIO2 his pO2 was 63 . It was increased to 65 with pO2 of 81 . At approximately 750 a.m.   house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70  40 with falling oxygen saturations . The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated . Within one minute   the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called . The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued . The patient &aposs prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained . The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade . Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion . The patient &aposs rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked   initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine   one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly   and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation . Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 830 a.m. The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .

The electrocardiogram revealed poor R wave progression and marked decrease in all volts . chest x-ray revealed prominent pulmonary vessels and enlarged heart . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  The patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed . The echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion   an ejection fraction of 30 and worsening systolic dysfunction . Hydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy . The patient diuresed and responded to Lasix 100 mg administered in the emergency room and was admitted to a monitored bed . At 430 AM the following morning the patient was found in cardiac arrest . Despite intravenous fluids   intravenous epinephrine   and multiple attempts at defibrillation   the patient was unable to be resuscitated . Upon arrival of the covering access physician the patient was being ventilated mechanically and CPR was being performed . The rhythm revealed sinus tachycardia with no palpable or measurable blood pressure . There were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions . A pericardiocentesis was attempted with no yield of pericardial fluid . A transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure . In total   the patient was defibrillated 10 times   given 5 courses of intravenous epinephrine   one course of intravenous Atropine and intravenous calcium x 1 in addition to an amp of bicarbonate .

Colitis . The patient has a history of ischemic bowel status post SMA Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty with recent admission for gram negative rod urosepsis complicated by C. difficile colitis . The patient received a full course of Flagyl and was C. difficile toxin negative times three prior to transfer . He now returns with fever   rising white count   diarrhea   and dehydration . Initially treated with intravenous ceftizoxime   gentamicin   and Flagyl for presumed sepsis   either with urine or bowel source . He was also started on p.o. Vancomycin . Blood cultures and urine cultures came back negative . Stool for C. difficile returned positive . The diagnosis   therefore   was relapsed C. difficile colitis . Intravenous antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was continued on p.o. Vancomycin . He improved clinically with defervescence   decreased white blood cell count to 10 000 with resolution of left shift   and some decrease in abdominal distention on exam . An abdominal CAT scan revealed thickened bowel wall and thumb printing   primarily involving the cecum and right colon greater than the left   consistent with C. difficile colitis . The diagnosis of recurrent bowel ischemia   however   was not ruled out and this will continue to be a concern in the future . The patient was initially n.p.o. and was then advanced to clear liquids which he tolerated . He will be advanced to soft solids prior to discharge . 2. Azotemia . The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.8-2 . Creatinine had risen to 4.3 on admission presumed secondary to sepsis and dehydration . With intravenous hydration the BUN and creatinine fell to 12  1.9 which is within normal limits for this patient . The abdominal CAT scan showed no evidence of hydronephrosis orrenal abscess . 3.

Chest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease   an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease . On the lateral view   surgical clips in the abdomen . EKG showed normal sinus rhythm   no ST or T wave changes . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  Mr. Finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory . He underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system . However   there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease . He had normal cervical vertebral arteries . Transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems   distal vertebrals   or proximal basilar artery . The proximal   middle   anterior and posterior cerebral arteries   however   could not be insinuated . Over the course of the first hospital day   the patient &aposs exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent . He had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission . A computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes   right greater than left   and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis . MRI    MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images   showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts   but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex . Because of his blood pressure   dependence of his left sided extremities   the lower leg specifically   he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days . His systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190   which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part . However   due to the absence of clear benefit at this level   and further deterioration in his left sided strength   this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range . This strategy and its incumbent risks   particularly in a patient on Heparin   were discussed at length with both the patient and his family   who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg . While in the Intensive Care Unit   his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength   and having a 2-3  5 power in his proximal left leg groups . He also   as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered   developed mild sensory findings   in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand   although he at times   including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference . In terms of exploring his visual space   he was able to look to the left   and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit . He was followed by speech and swallowing service   who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved   although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek . I should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache   although he also had this off the pressor . He had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation   but not extension of his prior infarct   both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images . Additionally   he had a perfusion   diffusion MR study earlier on   which suggested the presence of viable penumbra   including the overlying cortex . He was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy . At this time   his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm   severe hemiparesis of his left leg   mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm   and otherwise fairly intact mental status   cranial nerve function   and right sided motor and sensory function . We anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential . He will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of Coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an INR goal of 2-3   Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on 11  05  96   Dexedrine 5 mg po qd   Omeprazole 20mg po qd   Erythromycin eye ointment OU bid   Heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial thromboplastin time bid   and discontinuing when the Coumadin is therapeutic   Tylenol 650 mg po q4 prn   Colace 100 mg po bid .

Musculoskeletal  Normal spine   hip   clavicles   small mass at the site of previous right quadriceps intramuscular injection . An initial head CT scan had revealed extracranial soft tissue swelling most prominently at the right frontal-parietal-occipital area extending to the left and to the upper cervical region . Ventricles were symmetrical and not compressed . No gross intraparenchymal hemorrhage . But upon further radiology attending Stoughton   there was a small bilateral occipital subdural hemorrhage noted . The initial hematocrit was 21.2   platelets 186 . PT was 14.6   PTT 77 with an INR of 1.4 . Fibrinogen was 192 . D-dimer was negative . ASSESSMENT  This is a term infant with significant subgaleal hematoma with apparent extension over the past six hours . There was also elevation of the PTT suggesting possible inborn coagulopathy . There is also critical anemia secondary to the subgaleal hemorrhage . He was admitted to the CMED CCU for further management . SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS  1. Respiratory  Patient has been on room air maintaining sats above 95 . No apnea or bradycardia . 2. Cardiovascular  There was an initial murmur on admission likely secondary to severe anemia which has since resolved . He remained hemodynamically stable throughout this admission . 3. FEN  Patient was restarted on po feeds as of day of life three after the bleeding had stabilized . He has been taking breast milk or Enfamil 20 po adlib . His admission weight was 3850 grams . His weight on discharge was 4055 . 4. GI  Given the significant amount of bleeding   baby was started prophylactically on phototherapy . His bilirubin peaked on day of life three at 5.4 with a subsequent bilirubin of 4.6 at which time phototherapy was discontinued . 5. Hematology  Given the rapid extension of the subgaleal bleed   coagulopathy workup was initiated revealing an elevated PTT level of 77 as well as factor 8 level that was below detection in the presence of normal factors 5   9   10   and 11 . He was started on a 50 units    kg bolus of factor 8 followed by continuous factor 8 infusions at 50 units    kg    day divided until hourly infusion rates at 05-10 . Subsequent factor 8 levels varied with an initial factor 8 level of 18 after the bolus with which he received another bolus of factor 8 of 50 units    kg and increased factor 8 infusion rate to 65 units    kg    day . As of 05-17   he was switched over to bolus infusion in preparation of continued home factor 8 administration . His peak level after a bolus of 75 units    kg of factor 8 was 131 . A trough level at 20 hours after the bolus on day of discharge was 29 . He will continue to receive factor 8 bolus q day for a total of 2-3 weeks in light of the intracranial hemorrhage   and will be followed by Hematology visiting nurse Michael Edwards level checks at home . Currently   the infusion of factor 8 are going through a jugular Broviac which was placed on 05-15 for administration of factor . His last PTT on 05-16 was 68.3 . The last hematocrit was on 05-16 of 54.5 . 6. Neurology  Baby Mary Stead initially presented with significant subgaleal bleed as well as a small subdural hemorrhage . A repeat head CT scan on 05-15 had shown the resolution of the subdural hematoma and significant improvement of the subgaleal bleed . His head ultrasound on 05-14 reveals no interventricular hemorrhage . He had remained neurologically stable . His head circumference on 05-18 was 36.5 cm with a maximum head circumference on admission of 40.5 cm . 7. Social  Both parents are very involved in the care of Baby Norman Stead . They have been informed up to date on his needs   discharge from the hospital . Teaching has been completed on the care of the Boviak as well as administration of factor 8 . 8. Sensory  Audiology  Hearing screen was performed automated auditory brain stem responses and Baby David Stead passed bilaterally . CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  Baby Julian Stead had been stable with improvement of the subgaleal bleed and good peak and trough factor 8 levels after the bolus infusion . DISPOSITION  Baby Corine Stead is to be discharged home with parents with close Hematology VNA followup . NAME OF PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN  Dr. Pearly Reilly   208-4200 .

This is in comparison to 2015-09-27 EKG . Chest x-ray rotated low lung volumes   hazy opacities at bases . Echocardiogram in 2010  Mild-to-moderate MR   TR . HOSPITAL COURSE  1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure issues The patient presented with changes in mental status   pCO2 of 100   pH of 7.19   decreasing sats on arrival likely element of obstructive-sleep apnea . She was monitored overnight . She had admitted to the CMED and had multiple episodes of apnea throughout the night . She was placed on pressure support   which improved her saturations and decreased her hypercarbia . Patient improved that her mental status with improvement of her oxygenation and ventilation as well as for correction of her respiratory acidosis . Patient was eventually placed on BiPAP on hospital day three   on the date prior to discharge of BiPAP settings of 12  8  5 liters of oxygen with saturations of 96 with a gas of 7.38   67   and 91 with an aim of a goal pCO2 of 67 . She only had one episode of apnea on the day prior to discharge . 2. Delta MS  mental status issues  Most likely her waxing and waning mental status and hypercarbia  hypoxia compounded by infection of pneumonia and UTI . With improvements of her ventilation and oxygenation and treatment with levofloxacin of her UTI and pneumonia   her mental status greatly improved on hospital day two without further waxing and waning . Her daughters came by and visited her   and reported that she was at her baseline mental status on the day prior to discharge . B12   folate   RPR were all sent that were unremarkable as causes for delta MS . We are awaiting results of the lumbar puncture from the outside hospital   but on hospital day two . Those cultures are still pending at the time . Patient was also given multivites . 3. Fever issues  The patient initially presented with T max of 101.3 at outside hospital with increasing white blood cell counts and a positive urinalysis . A chest x-ray with bilateral patchy infiltrates likely pneumonia and UTI . Upon calling the outside hospital   the urine was growing out Klebsiella   and patient was given a 10 day course of levofloxacin to cover both the pneumonia and UTI . Blood cultures and urine cultures are still pending at this hospital visit and the CSF fluid from Whitter Rehabilitation Hospital needs to be further evaluated . Patient on the day of discharge was afebrile with a decreasing white count x48 hours . 4. Acute renal failure issues  Creatinine initially presented at 1.3 . Patient is known to have a baseline of 1.0   most likely hypovolemia and prerenal . A FENa was sent   was 0.3 . Patient was gently hydrated and IV fluids started up on a p.o. diet regimen . On hospital day two   her creatinine returned to 0.8   and she remained with a creatinine of 0.8 for the remainder of her hospital stay . Patients K was followed   and trended back down to normal on the day of discharge at 3.9 . 5. Elevated transaminases Patient had no right upper quadrant pain . Stewart sign was negative . A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed that showed no hepatic or biliary pathology likely due to acute phase stress changes given the fact that she had no clinical symptoms . There is no need to followup these transaminases . 6. Congestive heart failure history  Patient was stable without evidence of CHF on chest x-ray . Followed her sats likely due to obstructive-sleep apnea and hypoventilation . Patient was restarted on her beta blocker and .......  receptor blocker on hospital day two given that her creatinine had stabilized . Patient had no further cardiac issues at this time . She was on telemetry without any episodes of any rhythm abnormalities . 7. CMED CCU  The patient had some vaginal bleeding x2 days . Patient had a history of fibroids during this hospitalization . Followed her examination . Her hematocrit remained stable throughout this course . Patient is strongly encouraged to followup with her outside primary care provider to followup for the vaginal bleeding given her history of fibroids and question metaplasia of the endometrium . 8. Heme  Her hematocrit remained stable . She had a history of nucleated RBCs likely secondary to stress and hypoxia during this admission . Hemolysis laboratories were negative . Patient was restarted on her iron supplementation . Reticulocyte count was performed that was negative . 9. FEN  She was NPO with a decrease in her mental status . We slowly advanced her diet as her mental status improved and repleted her electrolytes   and started on her p.o. medications on hospital day two . 10. Diabetes  Patient had q.i.d. fingersticks with a Humalog sliding scale and NPH doses were cut in half while she was NPO   and they were brought back to her normal doses on the day of discharge with a full diet . 11. Code status  Full . Two daughters came by and requested to be health care proxies as patient approved . Documentation is in her medical chart . 12. Prophylaxis  The patient was on subQ Heparin for DVT and ranitidine for GI prophylaxis . DISPOSITION The patient is to be discharged today to Lahey Clinic  North Shore Hospital for long-term pulmonary ........ therapy and further evaluation of her obstructive-sleep apnea .,1,

While on transfer   the patient underwent cardiac catheterization . Please see cathed report for full details . In summary   the catheterization showed left main with no obstructive disease   LAD with 70 percent serial lesion   left circumflex with 70 percent proximal   OM1 and OM2 both 70 percent lesions   RCA with nonobstructive disease and ejection fraction of 25 percent . The patient was referred to CT surgery who was seen and accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting . On 09-06   he was brought to the Operating Room   please see the Operating Room report for full details . In summary   he had a coronary artery bypass graft times 4 with a LIMA to the LAD   saphenous vein graft OM1   saphenous vein graft OM2 and saphenous vein graft of the diagonal . His bypass time was 105 minutes with a cross clamp time of 87 minutes . He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the cardiothoracic ICU . At the time of transfer   he was AV paced at a rate of 88 beats per minute . He had Propofol at 30 mc per kg per minute and Neo-Synephrine to maintain his blood pressure . The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period . His anesthesia was reversed . He was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated . He remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of his operative day . On postoperative day 1   the patient remained hemodynamically stable on a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain an adequate blood pressure . He remained in the Intensive Care Unit as he was unable to be weaned off of his Neo-Synephrine drip . On postoperative day 1   his Swan-Ganz catheter was removed as well . On postoperative day 2   another attempt was made to wean the patient off of Neo-Synephrine unsuccessfully . His chest tubes were removed . However   because he could not be weaned from the Neo-Synephrine   he again remained in the Intensive Care Unit . On postoperative day 3   an additional attempt was made to wean the patient from his Neo-Synephrine unsuccessfully . The patient also received a unit of packed red blood cells in an additional attempt to wean from Neo-Synephrine . This also did not help in the attempt to wean from Neo-Synephrine . His Foley catheter was removed and he remained again in the ICU . On postoperative day 4   additional attempts were made to wean the patient off of his Neo-Synephrine   however   he continued to drop his blood pressure whenever an attempt was made . Other than that   the patient remained completely stable . On postoperative day 5   the patient was finally weaned off of his Neo-Synephrine and diuresis was begun . He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for an additional day to monitor his hemodynamics . On postoperative day 6   the patient remained hemodynamically stable and he was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation . Over the next two days   the patient had an uneventful hospitalization . His activity level was increased with the assistance of physical therapy department and the nursing staff . On postoperative day 7   it was decided that the patient would be stable and ready to be discharged to home on the following day . At the time of this dictation   the patient s physical examination is as follows  Vital signs were temperature 99   heart rate 84 in sinus rhythm   blood pressure was 114  63   Respiratory rate was 18   O2 sat was 94 percent on room air . Weight preoperatively was 88.5 kilos   at discharge was 90.4 kilos .

While on transfer   the patient underwent cardiac catheterization . Please see cathed report for full details . In summary   the catheterization showed left main with no obstructive disease   LAD with 70 percent serial lesion   left circumflex with 70 percent proximal   OM1 and OM2 both 70 percent lesions   RCA with nonobstructive disease and ejection fraction of 25 percent . The patient was referred to CT surgery who was seen and accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting . On 09-06   he was brought to the Operating Room   please see the Operating Room report for full details . In summary   he had a coronary artery bypass graft times 4 with a LIMA to the LAD   saphenous vein graft OM1   saphenous vein graft OM2 and saphenous vein graft of the diagonal . His bypass time was 105 minutes with a cross clamp time of 87 minutes . He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the cardiothoracic ICU . At the time of transfer   he was AV paced at a rate of 88 beats per minute . He had Propofol at 30 mc per kg per minute and Neo-Synephrine to maintain his blood pressure . The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period . His anesthesia was reversed . He was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated . He remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of his operative day . On postoperative day 1   the patient remained hemodynamically stable on a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain an adequate blood pressure . He remained in the Intensive Care Unit as he was unable to be weaned off of his Neo-Synephrine drip . On postoperative day 1   his Swan-Ganz catheter was removed as well . On postoperative day 2   another attempt was made to wean the patient off of Neo-Synephrine unsuccessfully . His chest tubes were removed . However   because he could not be weaned from the Neo-Synephrine   he again remained in the Intensive Care Unit . On postoperative day 3   an additional attempt was made to wean the patient from his Neo-Synephrine unsuccessfully . The patient also received a unit of packed red blood cells in an additional attempt to wean from Neo-Synephrine . This also did not help in the attempt to wean from Neo-Synephrine . His Foley catheter was removed and he remained again in the ICU . On postoperative day 4   additional attempts were made to wean the patient off of his Neo-Synephrine   however   he continued to drop his blood pressure whenever an attempt was made . Other than that   the patient remained completely stable . On postoperative day 5   the patient was finally weaned off of his Neo-Synephrine and diuresis was begun . He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for an additional day to monitor his hemodynamics . On postoperative day 6   the patient remained hemodynamically stable and he was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation . Over the next two days   the patient had an uneventful hospitalization . His activity level was increased with the assistance of physical therapy department and the nursing staff .

Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema . There was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  NEUROLOGY  The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition . He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity . It did   however   show diffuse slowing . He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination . His hypertension  his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit . He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move . He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right   but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission . His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy . It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process   but this was not clarified during this admission . It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &aposs disease   as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor   although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic . He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18   1996 . This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct   but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy . In addition   he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage   so tumor was felt to be unlikely . However   this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage . The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension   but these other causes could also not be ruled out . CARDIOVASCULAR  His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia . He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation . He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7   which makes for a percentage of 2.9 . That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6   1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot leaflet &quot . He remained chest pain free throughout his admission . PULMONARY  After his initial intubation he remained quite stable . He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex . However   he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission . HEMATOLOGY  He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room . His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation   but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed . It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 . He did drop below 1.5 at one time   at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period   but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time . It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems . GASTROINTESTINAL  He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision . Thus   his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19   1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well . In discussions with the family   given his age and number of medical problems   it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions . However   he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure . The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good   but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary   short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest . DISPOSITION    PLAN ON DISCHARGE  Stable . DOCTOR &aposS DISCHARGE ORDERS  The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital   the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary . The patient is to follow up with Dr. Ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .,1,

 BY SYSTEM  Respiratory  The baby was intubated in the Delivery Room   received two doses of surfactant . Radiograph revealed bilateral diffuse granular pattern consistent with surfactant deficiency . Maximum mechanical ventilation PIP 26   PEEP 6   rate of 25   maximum FIO2 35 percent . Mychelia was extubated to a CPAP of 6 cm on day of life two where she remained until day of life 20 . On day of life two   she was also loaded with caffeine and continues on caffeine at time of transfer . She was transitioned to a nasal cannula on day of life 20 and remains on nasal cannula O2 100 percent at 13 cc flow . She averaged 2-3 apnea episodes a day with bradycardia and desaturations . She has a comfortable respiratory rate and good air exchange . Cardiovascular  She received a normal saline bolus times one initially for poor perfusion and was started on dopamine with a maximum infusion rate of 6 mcg per kg per hour . This was discontinued on day of life two to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 33 . She has remained hemodynamically stable during the remainder of her hospitalization here . Fluids   electrolytes   nutrition  Initially maintained NPO . UAC and UVC lines were placed upon admission to the CMED . The UAC was left in place until day of life two and was removed after wean from dopamine . UVC remained in place through day of life six and was utilized to administer parenteral nutrition . Electrolytes and glucose remained in the normal range throughout the first week . She was started on enteral feeds on day of life six with a slow advance secondary to increased abdominal girth which was felt to be due to CPAP . She passed meconium . She achieved full feeds on day of life 13 . Calories were gradually increased to breast milk 30 calories with ProMod consisting of four of human milk fortifier   four of MCT and two of Polycose with a 12-28 teaspoon of ProMod per 50 ml of breast milk or 60 ml of formula . On day of life six due to concerns for hyperglycemia and abdominal distention   sepsis evaluation was obtained . She was noted at this time to have hyperglycemia requiring two subcutaneous doses of insulin and a decreased glucose infusion rate to achieve euglycemia . This resolved that same day . Urine output was always noted to be of sufficient quantity . Gastrointestinal  Mychelia demonstrated slow gastrointestinal motility and abdominal distention felt to be due to CPAP . She was slow to advance on enteral feeds and gradually attained full enteral volume on day of life 13 . On day of life 15   she was made NPO for a distended abdomen and a bilious spit . Serial KUBs revealed nonspecific changes with dilated loops . No pneumatosis or free air was seen . She was noted to have bluish discoloration thought to perhaps be a bruise on her left lower quadrant . There was no radiographic correlation with this . Feeds were restarted . Again   she was advanced to full volume but was made NPO on day of life 20 for abdominal distention . This NPO was temporary for that day and she then resumed feedings and has been tolerating full enteral feeds well   improved since off of CPAP   passing normal stools   guaiac negative . Mychelia was also treated for physiologic jaundice . She was started under phototherapy on day of life one through day of life three with a peak serum bilirubin of 4.7  0.3 . This issue resolved . Hematologic and Infectious Disease  Initial CBC was notable for a white count of 5.5 with 49 polys   1 band and 47 lymphs . Initial hematocrit was 46.3 percent and platelets 320 000 . Her initial blood culture remained negative and she received 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamicin . As previously noted on day of life six with hyperglycemia   abdominal distention   a CBC and blood culture were again obtained revealing a white count of 9.1 with 30 polys   0 bands and 58 lymphs . Hematocrit at that time was noted to be 31 and platelets 370 000 . Blood culture grew staph coagulase negative and the baby received seven days of vancomycin and gentamicin . A lumbar puncture was also performed to rule out meningitis . This culture remained negative with normal cell counts and chemistries . Antibiotic levels were monitored and doses adjusted accordingly . Mychelia required two transfusions during her hospital stay . On day of life 15 for a hematocrit of 29   she received 20 cc of packed red blood cells . She started on iron and vitamin E supplements on day of life 25 and continues on that at this time of transfer . However   on day of life 34   12-04   she was noted to be pale and less stress tolerant   mottling easily with care . A hematocrit and reticulocyte count showed a hematocrit of 23 percent and a reticulocyte count of 1.9 percent . Therefore   with blood available from the first aliquot   a second 20 cc per kg of packed red blood cells were infused without incident . Neurological  Initial head ultrasound on day of life seven was normal . At one month of age   on 12-03   she was noted to have an absent septum pellucidum . An MRI obtained and reviewed by the Hallmark Health System Radiology Department revealed focal gyral morphology consistent with prematurity   normal midline structures   normal myelination   no lesions   no signal abnormalities or extracerebral collections . The cortical ribbon is intact . The major vascular structures at the skull base are normal . The septal leaflets may be partially absent   but there are no coronal images provided for confirmation and the pituitary stalk is present . An Ophthalmology consult was obtained to determine the presence of optic nerves . These were both determined to be present and intact . Endocrine was also consulted . Several labs were ordered . Electrolytes and thyroid studies were noted to be in the normal range with serum sodium of 136   potassium 4.7   chloride 98 and CO2 34 . She had a calcium of 10.3   a phosphorus of 4.8 and alkaline phosphatase of 440 . Thyroid function studies revealed a TSH of 2.2   T4 of 5.7   T3 of 101 and a cortisol level of 43   all within the normal range . A growth hormone was sent and the results were pending at time of transfer . In addition   an FSH and LH were obtained on 12-10 and results are pending at time of transfer . Please contact lab control at Mattapan Community Health Center for results   409  238-8236 . The baby s neurologic examination is appropriate for corrected gestational age which is 33 and 6  7 weeks on day of transfer . By mother s report   a maternal cousin also has an absent septum pellucidum . Given normal pituitary tests thus far and normal optic nerve   no evidence of septic optic dysplasia . Pediatrician should have low threshold for endocrinology reconsult if any signs of pituitary problems . Sensory  Audiology hearing has not yet been obtained . This is recommended prior to discharge from hospital to home . Ophthalmology  Initial ROP screen was done on 12-02 and revealed immature retinas to zone 2 bilaterally . They recommended follow-up examination due on the week of 12  20 . Psychosocial  Gardner State Hospital social worker has assisted in working with this family . The contact may be reached at  754  791 7976 . Parents have been very involved and appropriate with infant and have eagerly learned to care for their baby . Condition at time of transfer is good . Discharge disposition is to level 2 nursery at Jordan Hospital Hospital . Name of primary pediatrician is Ashley Daley of Village Pediatrics in Stockbridge . Feedings at the time of transfer include breast milk 30 with ProMod at 150 cc per kg per day   all gavage given over one hour . Medications include Fer-In-Norman   vitamin E 5 international units each day and caffeine citrate once a day . Car seat positioning screening has not been obtained . Newborn state screens have been sent per protocol . Results have been in the normal range . IMMUNIZATIONS RECEIVED  Mychelia received hepatitis B vaccine on 11-02 due to unknown maternal hepatitis B surface antigen status . She also received hepatitis B immune globulin on 11-02 . On 12-06   she received her second hepatitis B vaccine . Her two month immunizations have not yet been given . IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from November through March for infants who meet any of the following three criteria  1 born at less than 32 weeks   2 born at between 32 and 35 weeks with two of the following  Daycare during RSV season   a smoker in the household   neuromuscular disease   airway abnormalities or school age siblings or 3 infants with chronic lung disease . Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall for all infants once they reach 6 months of age . Before this age and for the first 24 months of the infant s life   immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home caregivers . Follow-up appointments recommended with the primary pediatrician   Dr. Marilyn Daley of Stockbridge   Village Pediatrics   Dr. Lynn Warren of Neurology from Emerson Hospital and Ophthalmology to follow her ophthalmology status .

 BY SYSTEM 1. PULMONARY  She was treated with albuterol and Atrovent continuous nebulizers and was weaned then to intermittent nebulizer treatments and then to her meter-dosed inhalers taking them q.4h. at the time of discharge . She was continued on salmeterol and Flovent . She was continued on Solu-Medrol 80 mg q.8h. then converted to prednisone at 60 mg p.o. q.d. She was started on Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d. Serial arterial blood gases were followed after an arterial line was placed . Her PCO2 gradually declined to the 48 range . Despite episodes of somnolence the first night which were presumably due to having spent the entire night in the Emergency Department   she never became more hypercarbic   and her PCO2 trended to 48 by the time the arterial line was discontinued . On the night of admission and thereafter   she was noted to have a very stridorous sounding breathing when the patient was asleep . This would disappear whenever she was awake . Her case was discussed with Ear  Nose  Throat and the Medical Intensive Care Unit attending . She was given a trial of 80  20 mixed helium  oxygen to decrease the stridor but had minimal effect . Ear  Nose  Throat recommended not considering this an airway problem unless she was stridorous while awake . The patient was to arrange for Pulmonary and Medicine followup through her primary care physician upon discharge as she has not been seen in the Pulmonary Clinic in two years . 2. CARDIOVASCULAR  The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial creatine kinases   although these did rise to 816 . MB was negative . She was treated with captopril for hypertension   and this was switched to Norvasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. on discharge . She had an echocardiogram which showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular of normal thickness and size   and no significant valvular disease . She apparently did not have a cardiovascular component to her wheezing or shortness of breath  however   she was to go home on Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. to help with lower extremity edema   as she experiences discomfort with this   and the team felt this may be a limiting factor with her prednisone compliance . 3.

 Respiratory  On admission   infant did not require supplemental oxygen or respiratory support . Since that time   Jadiara has always been in room air without requiring supplemental oxygen . She was noted to have apnea of prematurity   treated with caffeine until 2017-06-04 . Since that time   she has had very rare spells   with none for over one week by the time of discharge . Cardiovascular  She was hemodynamically stable upon admission with normal blood pressures and heart rate . On day of life 15   she was noted to have a murmur   eventually prompting evaluation by ECHO . The ECHO revealed an anomalous left coronary   with one end entering the right ventricular outflow tract and the other end not clearly defined . It was unable to be delineated whether this represented an anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery  LCAPA  or a left coronary artery fistula to the pulmonar artery . The right coronary was prominent   and there appeared to be coronary artery collateral vessels in the posterior apical myocardium . A small apical muscular VSD was also noted . Several additional ECHOs were performed   including an ECHO in the cardiology department at HealthSouth Rehab Hospital of Western Mass.   but the anatomy of the left coronary artery could not be further defined . Due to the risks of coronary ischemia if this represented an LCAPA   the infant was followed with regular ECHOs and EKGs during the remainder of hospitalization   with no evidence of ischemia   valvular regurgitation   or compromised ventricular function . She will be continued to be followed closely by cardiology as an outpatient   with likely plans for cardiac catheterization and surgical repair when she grows to 3.5 to 4 kg . Fluids   electrolytes and nutrition  The infant was initially maintained on IVF   with introduction of enteral feeds on day of life 2 . She was advanced to full volume enteral feeds by day of life 7   and then to a maximum caloric density of 28 cals    oz . Oral feedings were introduced as tolerated . By the time of discharge   infant is feedign BM or enfamil 24 cals    oz PO ad lib   with adequate intake and adequate weight gain . Last nutrition labs were on 06-20 with AP of 208   Ca 10.8   and Phos 7.4. Gastrointestinal  The infant required phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia through day of life 7   with peak bilirubin of 7    0.3 on day of life 3   and last bilirubin of 4.9    0.3 on day of life 9 . Hematologic    Infectious disease  CBC and blood culture were obtained upon admission revealing a white blood cell count of 9.0 with 25 polys and 0 bands  hematocrit was 46.9 and platelets of 222 000 . Baby received 48 hours of Ampicillin and Gentamycin with negative cultures and a stable clinical course . Infant was treated with supplemental iron   and did not receive any blood transfusions . Last Hct was 30.6 on 06-20 with a reticulocyte count of 6.5. Neurologic  Baby has been appropriate for gestational age . Social  Mother is 17 years old   and has been accompanied on the majority of her visits by her parents   both of whom are students . The infant s maternal grandparents have been very involved in her care .

 The patient is a 47 year old white male with a history of emphysema who presents for admission with a diagnosis of broncho-alveolar carcinoma and is scheduled for flexible bronchoscopy   mediastinoscopy and thoracotomy with questionable pneumonectomy by Dr. An on 12-4-93 . The patient is a native of Nahuter with a 70 pack year smoking history  2 1  2-3 pack per day x 35 years  whose symptoms began last 12  92 when he had a persistent cough and fever . In six months   he was hospitalized for pneumonia x four . He has had worsening dyspnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea   though denies orthopnea . No hemoptysis   no fevers   chills   sweats   when pneumonia resolved . The patient also noticed a loss of weight of approximately 25 pounds over a few months with increased fatigue and lower extremity weakness . A &quot spot &quot in the left lower lobe on chest X-ray was noted in October of 1993   after his pneumonia cleared . A follow up chest computerized tomography scan led to a tissue biopsy via flexible bronchoscopy in 07  93 . Tissue returned well differentiated adenocarcinoma . The patient was told nothing could be done until he was referred to Dr. An . His appetite has been good and he has only complained of occasional sharp pain under his rib cage   right greater than left .,1,
 The patient was admitted to Vencor Hospital . He was given fresh frozen plasma to correct his INR and a left chest tube was placed . Over the first 12 hours the chest tube drained 2 500 cc . On hospital day two the patient was transferred from the cardiac surgery recovery unit to 07-02 for continuing care . He remained hemodynamically stable . His chest tube drainage reduced significantly after the first 24 hours and on hospital day three his chest tube was discontinued . Over the next several days the patient remained in the hospital to reassess for recurrent pleural effusion . On 09-02 it was decided that the patient was stable and ready to be transferred back to rehabilitation however case management was unable to get authorization from the patient s insurance company and he remained in the hospital throughout the holiday weekend awaiting insurance authorization for transfer back to rehabilitation .

 1. cerebrovascular accident . The patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery . This was determined by head CT   head MRI   head MRA   carotid noninvasive studies   transcranial Dopplers . The possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor . Her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function   a patent foramen ovale   with a trace right to left shunt   as determined by bubble study   trace MR was present . Previous echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital . Her Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT   but was otherwise unremarkable . The patient had a normal B12   negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization . She was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started . Her exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point   however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day . Her pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge . She needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight   5  22  92 . In addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour . It is discontinued at the time of transport . The patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete . During evaluation of her neurologic status   it was determined that for several months prior to admission   the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate . On our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia   especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown . There are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen . At the time we were to embark on this evaluation   the patient &aposs family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital . What follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia . Her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function   though this is not certain . Moreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions . Our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome   relating to her history of breast Ca . As I mentioned above   her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time . While mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal   the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head . Two possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody . These tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge . The results can be obtained by paging me   Do A. Joasscchird   M.D. at 834-364-2251 . I will be happy to furnish the results . The patient has a history of MI in 1989 . Echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities . EKG   when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q  wave inversion . We would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension   but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this . Persantine thallium is scheduled at this time   but is yet to be performed . The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years . It has been evaluated in the past without success . During her hospitalization   we confirmed the presence of this   even when she was hydrated with saline   to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2 . Studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia . Studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal . This is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk . Florinef is to be considered   however stopping the Isordil is one goal . The patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia . In addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection . This has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray . CT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings . A chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding . A PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday   4 26th . The left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa . The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990   for which she received 6 months of Coumadin . Dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission . It is doubtful that she has chronic PE   but this is one consideration . It is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease   and so this is a consideration . The patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 . We think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic . This can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time . The patient has glaucoma . Her medications are as listed below . Her ophthalmologist is aware of transfer . His name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033   b 549 .

 Family history is not significant for any early history of coronary artery disease . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION Examination on admission to the Coronary Care Unit revealed blood pressure was 100  57   with a mean arterial pressure of 75   heart rate was sinus rhythm at 75   temperature was 97.6   oxygen saturation was 99 on assist control with a tidal volume of 600 on 60 FIO2   5 of positive end-expiratory pressure . In general   she was sedated at the time   responsive to stimuli   and was following commands . She had moist mucous membranes . Her carotids were 2 bilaterally . Her lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly . Her heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a faint second heart sound and second heart sound . No audible extra heart sounds . Her abdomen was obese and had positive bowel sounds . It was soft and nontender . She had peripheral edema with 2 peripheral pulses bilaterally . PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION  Her laboratories at the time of transfer to Saint Vincent Hospital revealed white blood cell count was 11.5   hematocrit was 42 on admission   platelets were 242 . Chemistry-7 was unremarkable . Creatine kinase on admission was 309   with a MB of 19.6   an index of 6.3   and an initial troponin of 0.73 . RADIOLOGY    IMAGING  A chest x-ray revealed an enlarged mediastinum with clear lung fields bilaterally . Initial electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 65   normal axis   2-mm ST elevations in lead III   1-mm ST elevations in aVF and V1   1-mm ST depressions in I and aVL  consistent with an inferior and right ventricular infarction . Right-sided electrocardiograms showed 1-mm ST elevations in V4  consistent with a right ventricular infarct . Electrocardiogram status post percutaneous coronary intervention revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 84   with a normal axis   and normalizing of the inferior ST segments   with Q waves evolving in leads III and aVF . An echocardiogram status post percutaneous coronary intervention revealed an akinetic inferior wall and right ventricle   mild mitral regurgitation   and ascending aorta measuring 5 cm . There was no effusion . HOSPITAL COURSE  1. CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM  On the night of admission   the patient experienced post catheterization hypotension which required intravenous fluids and dopamine . Electrocardiogram the following morning revealed normalization of her ST segments with evolution of Q waves . Her dopamine was weaned off the following day   and her heparin was discontinued secondary to a right groin hematoma which had developed after the sheath had been pulled out by the fellow . Her creatine kinases climbed  reaching a peak of 3523   which was down to 1500 at the time of discharge . Also noted on the day of 11-20   the patient self-extubated herself . For her coronary artery disease   status post catheterization   she was given Integrilin for 18 hours . She was continued on aspirin   Plavix   and Lipitor . For her rhythm   amiodarone was discontinued as she was maintained in sinus rhythm after moving to the floor . For pump   once transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit on 2011-11-20   a beta blocker was begun at 12.5 mg of Lopressor p.o. b.i.d. which was titrated to 25 mg at the time of discharge . Also   at the time of discharge   for increased afterload reduction   she was started on lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. On 2011-11-21   the patient experienced atypical chest pain which was made worse with inspiration and movement . It was not associated with any nausea or vomiting . It did not radiate . It was felt to be pain secondary to her self-extubation and noncardiac chest pain . An electrocardiogram was checked which revealed no ST changes   and there was no increase in her downward trending creatine phosphokinases . No further intervention was done . The patient was treated with Tylenol orally as well as Ativan for anxiety that she had about going home . She was pain free on the day of discharge . Regarding her aortic ascending aneurysm   Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted regarding further workup . At their request   a CT scan of the chest with contrast was performed on the day of discharge . Dr. Streeter from Cardiothoracic Surgery will follow up with the patient for further management in approximately one month as an outpatient . His office will contact her to make that appointment . 2. PULMONARY SYSTEM  As stated above   the patient self-extubated herself . She complained of a sore throat which was likely the etiology of her atypical chest complaints . This resolved with Tylenol and as needed doses of oxycodone . Her lungs remained clear to auscultation bilaterally throughout the remainder of her hospital course . At the time of this dictation   the CT of her chest was still pending . The official result was not yet in . 3. FLUIDS    ELECTROLYTES    NUTRITION  The patient s electrolytes sere managed daily and repleted on an as needed basis . She did receive intravenous K-Phos for a low phosphorous of 1.5 . Her phosphorous rose appropriately to 3.6 at the time of discharge . DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP 1. The patient has an appointment to initiate primary care   as she no longer had a primary care physician . Claire was to see Dr. Michael Majerowski at the Sturdy Memorial Clinic on the east campus   on Bissonette Six   in the South Suite   on 31-05-03 at 1130 a.m. 2. In addition   as stated above   Dr. Hastings office from Cardiothoracic Surgery will be in contact with Ms. Williams to arrange followup for her ascending aortic aneurysm in approximately one month .,3,

LDH was 38.9   CK was 66   her hematocrit was 27.4   white count was 8.0 and her platelets were 55 . PT was 14.5   PTT 25.5 . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded . On transfer to the Lemgarson Hospital service   her hematocrit was 31.2   white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 . Her PT was 13.1   PTT 26.7 . The rest of her labs were unremarkable . She was watched very closely while on the floor . She was on GI bleed precautions at all times   was too large for IV . She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked . She was kept NPO until January 26 when she began to feel hungry . At that time clear liquids were started . All of her stools were guaiaced . She also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension . The GI consult team continued to follow her . We also tried to contact her physician at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and was unsuccessful . Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis . She was described as having cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology . Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative . She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin . Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin   which was negative . She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding . Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 . We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis . The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244   total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5   globulin 0.3   amylase 16   LDH of 51 . The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension . The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16 polys . She therefore criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis . Her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine . Therefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec . By the 2th the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home . She wanted to be closer to North Dakota . After discussion with her private physician   Dr. Joasscchird   tel. 090-249-6079   at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and Dr. Acrookesjo at Do Of Hospital   the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with AH and physical therapy . She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital . She is to follow up with Dr. Acrookesjo in one week and Dr. Work the gastrointestinal fellow here at PUOMC in 2 weeks . She may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding . The patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker   therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .,0,
 On admission   the patient s birth weight was 1.705 kilograms   which is 50th percentile . Length was 40 cm   50th percentile . Head circumference was 30 cm   50th percentile . The patient was born at 32 and 4  7 weeks gestation and brought directly to the CMED CSRU .,0,
 On examination on transfer to the Intensive Care Unit she is febrile with a low grade temperature of 100.1   tachycardic to 110   hypotensive 85  49   tachypneic into the 50 s and 60 s  95 on nonrebreather . In general   she is extremely tachypneic   difficulty in speaking words . Her heart is regular without murmurs   rubs or gallops   slightly tachycardic . Her pulmonary examination shows she has bronchial breath sounds with dry crackles at the bases . Abdominal examination was benign . Extremities no clubbing   cyanosis or edema . She is alert and following commands . LABORATORY  White blood cell count 3.2   hematocrit 26.6   platelets 130 chemistry is 131   potassium 3.0   chloride 105   bicarb 17   BUN 10   creatinine 0.5   glucose 105 . Calcium 7.3   phos 1.8   magnesium 1.5 . She had a gas showing 7.36   31   96 . She had a CT from the 29th of her abdomen and pelvis showing marked increased consolidations at the left lung base and question of new left sided pleural effusion . HOSPITAL COURSE  1. Pulmonary  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory distress and febrile hypotension with a question of a new infiltrate on her chest x-ray . The exact etiology of the patient s respiratory distress was presumed to be questionable multifactorial . There was concern about possible pneumonia . Also she had a history of PE and also there was concern about possible lymphangitic spread of her breast CA . Given her fevers and shortness of breath the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics initially started on Ceptaz   Levaquin and and Clindamycin . Lab two antibiotics were added considering the patient was thought to be a relatively high risk for PCP Douglas . The patient was initially trialed on BiPAP   but the patient was increasingly dyspneic   increased respiratory stress and ultimately needed to be intubated on 06-22 . Earlier during her Intensive Care Unit course she underwent bronchoscopy   which was sent for cytology and multiple bacterial pathogens all of which were negative . Ultimately her Intensive Care Unit course continued and she began to defervesce and her bacterial studies particulaly from BAL lavage were found to be negative . The patient had multiple antibiotics withdrawn . Clindamycin and was discontinued early in hospital course . Her PCP was thought to be negative . In addition   Vancomycin   Levaquin were also discontinued . She was later continued on Ceftazidine and Clindamycin for possible gram negative infection and also for possible post obstructive picture that she would be at risk for given her pulmonary anatomy . As the Hubbard Regional Hospital hospital course went on the patient s respiratory did not show mild improvement on the ventilator . She was able to oxygenate originally . Unfortunately her mental status failed to improve despite having been off all sedative medications for several days . Later in her Intensive Care Unit course family meetings took place and given the patient s overall poor prognosis with decreased mental status it was decided that the patient would become CMO . Subsequently she was extubated on 06-28 . The patient continues to actually ventilate well off of the respiratory . However   she is CMO and will not be intubated for respiratory distress . 2. Cardiovascular  The patient was initially transferred to the Intensive Care Unit thought to be exhibiting septic physiology   respiratory distress and hypotensive . She required aggressive intravenous fluids and later required pressor support with neo-synephrine . Later during her Intensive Care Unit course she was felt to be somewhat overloaded and intravenous fluids were cut back . It was quite difficult weaning her off of neo-synephrine . She was also given stress dose steroids . Later in her hospital course she also had an echocardiogram for question of new ECG findings in her inferior leads . Her echocardiogram   however   was essentially normal with an ejection fraction of 55 without any gross wall motion abnormalities or valvular pathology . As mentioned above the patient s hemodynamic status was tenuous throughout her hospital course as it was difficult to wean the patient off of neo-synephrine . By 06-28   however   the patient had been off of neo-synephrine   but at this time as mentioned above the patient was deemed to be CMO per discussion with physicians and her husband    health care proxy . 3. Hematology  Patient with a history of known malignancy and also a history of pulmonary embolisms from 2012-04-23 . Earlier in her Intensive Care Unit course the team was concerned about possible pulmonary embolisms as a possible source of the patient s respiratory decompensation . However   the patient also had brain metastasis and at this point anticoagulation was thought to be a contraindication given risk for hemorrhage into these tumors . She did have lower extremity doppler ultrasounds   which were negative . 4. Infectious disease  As mentioned above patient initially hypotension   febrile and in respiratory distress presumed to be septic source likely pulmonary . Initially the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin   Ceptaz   Levaquin   Clindamycin and . All of her cultures are negative to date . She was negative for PCP and subsequently was continued and Clindamycin was changed for anaerobic coverage . In addition her Vancomycin and Levaquin were also discontinued . The patient remained afebrile during the majority of her hospital course . By virtue of discussions on 06-28 the patient was deemed to be CMO and all antibiotics were withdrawn at this point . 5. Gastroenterology  The patient had an abdominal CT earlier in her Intensive Care Unit course   which was essentially negative for an intraabdominal pathology . She was initially supported with tube feeds during her Intensive Care Unit course   but at this point the patient is CMO and tube feeds have been subsequently discontinued . DISPOSITION  The patient s attending physician was in constant communication with the patient s health care proxy her husband . As her Intensive Care Unit course continued and the patient showed minimal signs of meaningful improvement   continued discussions were had with the family about possibly changing code status . Ultimately it was decided by 06-28 that the patient had shown minimal improvement and minimal evidence of improvement status   it was decided at this point for the patient to be extubated and to move toward CMO care . Subsequently all antibiotics   blood draws and supportive blood pressure medications were withdrawn . Currently she is comfortable with morphine and Ativan prn. Currently plans are in the making for arranging for the patient to have home hospice care . Please see discharge addendum for further developments in the patient s care .

 1  Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia  The video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . The patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay . This was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems   see below . By discharge   she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper . The patient &aposs bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course   however on July 12   1998   after starting dialysis  see below    the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen . Repeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually   the patient &aposs pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks . At the time of her discharge   the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90 . 2  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  The patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28   hematocrit of 32   LDH of 496 with 2 schistocytes and 2 spherocytes on her smear . This was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20   1998   she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27   1999 . She was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge . Her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3   1998   then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20   1999 . Her LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s   but remained elevated . She continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear   but it was much decreased . The patient also required red blood cell transfusions   approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit . Eventually   her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27   1999 . After this   the patient &aposs platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge . It is felt that the patient &aposs thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved . She will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper . 3  Renal  The patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 . Throughout the month of June   she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12   1998 . The opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week . She required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload . During the course of her dialysis   she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation . 4  Infectious disease The patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23   1998   July 4   1998   July 8   1998 and July 9   1998 . The patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10   1998 which remained patent and uninfected . She received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime . In addition   she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation   which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days . She also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21   1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus . She was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days . The patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids . 5  Rheumatology  The patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative . Unfortunately throughout her admission   we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange . A repeat ANA   rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient . FOLLOW-UP  1  The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician   Dr. Tamarg Study   in Arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation . 2  The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on Monday   Wednesday and Friday . The nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. Study . 3  The patient will continue to have her CBC   LDH   bilirubin   chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm   the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 . 4  The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula . The left subclavian Tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time . She would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this . 5  The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 . 6  The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month  this was started on July 27   1999  and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary . 7  The patient has a follow-up appointment in the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Cedwi Stone at 336-2931 on August 30   1999 at 140 PM . 8  The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm at the We Erthunt Hospital at 180-0455 on August 15   1999 at 1230 PM .

 1  Cardiovascular  The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction . She remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time . The patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities . The patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix . The patient &aposs Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm . The patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia . At this time   the patient &aposs presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology . 2  Neurological    vascular  The discrepancy in the patient &aposs pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis . The patient underwent MRI    MRA of the head   neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis   proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery . The left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon . The patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA . MRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct . The patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease . The patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally . The results of these studies suggested that the patient &aposs symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon   and therefore   it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and    or surgical or percutaneous intervention . A Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient &aposs intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure . 3  Orthopedic The patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event . Outside hip films were obtained   but were not available for view . Repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture   likely new . An Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance . A bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative . At the time of this dictation   the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of Physical Therapy and a walker .Plan,0,
 A Neurosurgery consultation was obtained   and it was their impression that the patient &aposs paraplegia might possibly represent a cord concussion   and recommended treatment with intravenous steroids for 24 hours . The patient &aposs paraplegia resolved by the morning of her second hospital day   and she maintained 5  5 motor strength in all groups . A Urology consultation was obtained   and it was recommended that an IVP be obtained . This was obtained on the day of discharge   however   due to residual contrast in the colon from the patient &aposs prior abdominal CT scan the exam was postponed after a scout film was obtained . The patient fell well on the day of discharge . She remained afebrile throughout her hospital course . Additionally on the night before discharge   flexion and extension views of the lumbosacral spine were obtained   and showed no fracture or instability . DISPOSITION  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  Good .,0,
 A quantitative V    Q scan was also done preoperatively and Pulmonary consult was obtained preoperatively . Pulmonary recommended that he just be started on Albuterol and Atrovent metered dose inhalers   2 puffs q6h   prior to surgery . The patient underwent his procedure on 12-4-93   without complications . Findings included thickened pleura with multiple adhesions and an abscess near the margin major fissure . He had a firm nodule in the left lower lobe . The patient was transferred to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit in stable condition and had an uneventful stay there . He had oxygen saturations of 99 with an Fi02 of 40 and had no complaints . He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number one and tolerated his PO&aposs well . His left lower lobe micro results revealed alpha hemolytic Streptococcus on culture and he was then switched to penicillin and Gentamicin after being started on triples of Flagyl   Ampicillin   and Gentamicin . He had low grade temperatures   though did not spike a high temperature during his hospital course . His hospital course was otherwise uneventful and the patient was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day   afebrile . The chest X-ray on the morning of discharge was unchanged from the previous day   with slight increase in left pleural fluid . He had completed six days of penicillin and Gentamicin and was discharged on Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl for the next seven days . He stayed at the local Comfort Inn before his return back to Aujer Cin .,0,

 After consultation with Cardiology as well as Anesthesia on call that evening   it was decided to transfer the patient to the ICU for intensive monitoring . Central IV access was obtained . The patient was carefully diuresed over the next 48 hours . Symptoms of congestive heart failure gradually abated over the next 48 to 72 hours . The patient was given antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity . A Neonatology consultation was obtained during the course of the hospitalization . After discussion   it was decided to attempt to obtain 28 weeks gestation and then deliver electively by cesarean section given the decompensation in the third trimester . The patient underwent primary low transverse cesarean section on 2014-05-19 at approximately 28 weeks gestation . The cesarean section was performed on the West Campus in the Cardiothoracic Surgical Suite . This was performed in this location in case any acute cardiac decompensation occurred during the time of cesarean section . Cardiothoracic Surgery was on standby during the surgery . The patient went to the cardiac Intensive Care Unit on the West Campus postoperatively . She did well during the postoperative period . She required several episodes of diuresis due to increasing shortness of breath on postoperative day 1 and postoperative day 2 due to worsening symptoms of shortness of breath from fluid shifts that normally occur during the postpartum period . The patient was transferred to the West Campus on postoperative day 2 in stable condition . She did well during the remainder of her postoperative course and was continued on her medication regimen that she had been on during the antepartum period . She was discharged to home on postoperative day 4 . She was to followup with Maternal Fetal Medicine in 5 to 7 days . She had followup with her primary cardiologist in Shaugnessy-Kaplan Rehab Hospital scheduled for 1 week postoperatively . Of note   the patient also underwent tubal ligation at the time of cesarean section .,0,

Humulin Walters insulin 24 units subcutaneous q A.M. and 8 to 16 in the evening depending upon where his blood sugar has been . Preoperative laboratory values were unremarkable . The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 2011-10-17 which revealed a 20 left vein osteal lesion as well as 70 LAD lesion and an 80 right coronary . The patient was taken to the operating room on 2011-10-18 where he underwent an aortic valve replacement with 23 mm pericardial valve as well as coronary artery bypass graft times two with a LIMA to the LAD and saphenous vein to the acute marginal . Postoperatively the patient was transported to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on Milrinone   Neo-Synephrine and Levophed drip . The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and subsequently extubated on the night of surgery . He remained on Levophed   Milrinone and Neo-Synephrine drips and was hemodynamically stable . N. Saez clinic consult was obtained due to hyperglycemia and the need for insulin drip in the Intensive Care Unit . On postoperative day the Milrinone was weaned down . The Levophed had been discontinued as the Neo-Synephrine and the patient was beginning to progress hemodynamically . Upon discontinuation of the Milrinone the patient s SV02 had dropped significantly in the low 50 s. The patient had decreased exercise tolerance and therefore was placed back on his milrinone to keep his cardiac index greater than 2.0 . Over the next couple of days it was very slowly decreased as his Ace inhibitors were increased orally . The patient ultimately was weaned off the Milrinone   transitioned to Captopril on postoperative day five and remained hemodynamically stable . Once the patient had remained off of inotropics for approximately 24 hours   he had been given diuretics and Ace inhibitors and remained hemodynamically stable he was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the Telemetry floor on postoperative day six . A physical therapy evaluation was obtained for assistance and mobility . Cardiac rehabilitation was initiated at that time . On 2011-10-24 postoperative day six consultation heart failure cardiology service was obtained . It was their recommendation to continue Ace inhibitors   to continue daily weights   to switch the patient to a long acting beta-blocker and to enroll the patient in postoperative cardiac rehabilitation as well as to make sure the patient was on statin drugs . These measures were all instituted . The patient continued to progress from cardiac rehabilitation and physical therapy standpoint while on the floor . The patient remained hemodynamically stable over the next few days   continued to increase with physical therapy and ambulation . His blood sugars were followed by the Cape Cod Hospital Clinic service and insulin has been adjusted accordingly . Today   2011-10-31   postoperative day 13 the patient remains stable and ready for discharge to home . The patient s condition today is as follows  Temperature 96.9 F   pulse 84   respiratory rate 18   blood pressure 106  59 . Most recent laboratory values are from 2011-10-25 which revealed a white blood cell count 8.4000   hematocrit 35   platelet count 202 000.

In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded . In October   1989   Dr. No re-did her bypass operation . She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending   saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 . In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block . She had exertional angina at that time . In November   1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis   high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft . She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis . Since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning   radiating to the left neck and arm   relieved by nitroglycerin . She was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . Because these symptoms have been increasing   particularly at cardiac rehabilitation   she was referred here . In May   1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic . She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect . She has had no syncope . Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol . She has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother   sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction . She is a remote cigarette smoker . She also has a history of lactose intolerance   peptic ulcer disease   with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages . She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .,0,

Chest pain  The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction . However   with her history of disease   patient underwent a cardiac catheterization . The patient was found at cardiac catheterization to have mild diffuse instent restenosis in the mid stent   otherwise hemodynamically normal and the coronary arteries otherwise were without flow-limiting stenoses . The patient was then continued on her cardiac medications . It was felt that if we attempted aspirin desensitize her while an inpatient   then she would benefit from the use of aspirin and Plavix . The patient was sent to the CCU and underwent aspirin desensitization protocol   which she tolerated well . She had mild worsening of her asthma attacks   which was relieved by Benadryl and occasionally albuterol . The patient found that if she took the aspirin in the evening with her Benadryl that she takes for sleep   that the asthma exacerbation did not occur . Aspirin no longer should be considered an allergy for this patient   and she is going to take this as an outpatient . 2. Hyperlipidemia  The patient s Lipitor was increased to 80 mg q.d. 3.

 BY SYSTEM  1. NEUROLOGY  Mr. Roach was transported to Intensive Care Unit from the trauma bay . Upon arrival   Neurosurgery promptly placed V. Holtzen bolt . This allowed continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure . Notably   intracranial pressure was 17 when the bolt was placed . During his hospitalization   his intracranial pressure was monitored very closely and maintained to a level of less than 20 . To do this   mannitol 25 mg q. 6h. was used . While using mannitol   his serum osmolalities were followed closely . In addition   to monitoring his intracranial pressure   his systemic blood pressures were maintained in such a manner that his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg . A parameter monitor for his neurologic status PaCO2 which was maintained between 35 and 40 during his hospitalization . Mr. Roach was kept sedated with propofol and was given Fentanyl and    or morphine boluses for pain . Neurologic checks were followed initially every one hour and then every two hours to monitor for change in neurologic examination . During his hospitalization   two subsequent CAT scans were obtained  one on hospital day two . This CAT scan revealed possible worsening and was read as epidural versus subdural bleed . After a discussion with both Radiology and Neurosurgery   the decision was made that the worsening did not appear significant   and this was not accompanied by a change in his clinical condition . His intracranial pressure remained stable   and his clinical examination was unchanged . An additional CT scan was obtained on hospital day three . This examination was unchanged from the previous examination . Again   his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same   and conservative treatment was opted for . CARDIOVASCULAR  As described in previous section   Neo-Synephrine and eventually Levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than 70 . A pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four . This catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support . Please see Infectious Disease section for more details . 3. GASTROINTESTINAL  Mr. Roach was n.p.o. from the time of his admission . A orogastric tube was passed . Initially during admission   carafate was given down the orogastric tube . However   on a routine chest x-ray shot on hospital day three   a mediastinum was noted . This raised the question of potential esophageal rupture . Gastroenterology was consulted for this . Gastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status . At this point   his carafate was switched to intravenous Protonix and he was strictly n.p.o. 4. HEMATOLOGY  Throughout Mr. Richard admission   his hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s . As will be discussed in the Infectious Disease section   he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis   and his white blood cell count peaked at 23 . Mr. Roach was on Pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis . He was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage . An inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred   as it was felt that Mr. Roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure . 5. ENDOCRINE  Mr. Marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from 100 to 130 using a regular insulin sliding-scale . 6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE  Mr. Roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers . His blood urine and sputum were all cultured . Blood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram  positive coagulase  negative Staphylococcus which grew from 08-25 . His preliminary cultures including sputum from 08-25 grew Escherichia coli . Sputum from 08-27 grew gram-negative rods   not yet speciated   and from 08-27 a bronchoalveolar lavage grew 1 gram-negative rods and 4 polymorphonuclear lymphocytes . Throughout this time   Mr. Richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four   his temperature maximum was 42.2 degrees centigrade . During his hospitalization   his was treated with vancomycin for his gram-negative rods   imipenem   and Flagyl . Initially   he had been placed on clindamycin to cover his drain   but his cultures became positive   and his white blood cell count increased . He was switched from clindamycin to the imipenem and Flagyl . Vancomycin was added when we had the positive blood culture . With a fever of 102   up to 42 degrees centigrade   aggressive measures including cooling blankets   alcohol swabs   and fans were used in an attempt to bring his body temperature down . Hypercarbia would result and increase in cerebral perfusion   paralysis was initiated to decrease genesis of carbon dioxide secreted during shivering . 7. PULMONARY  As discussed in the Infectious Disease section   Mr. Roach developed a pneumonia likely from gram-negative organisms   but most likely from Escherichia coli . For this pneumonia   he was placed empirically on imipenem   vancomycin   and Flagyl . On hospital day three   Mr. Roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea . For this   a CT angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism . On hospital day four   a routine chest x-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax . For this   a left 34 Caucasian chest tube was placed . On the evening of hospital day four   Mr. Roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole . Urgent resuscitation measures were initiated . The measures included attempts at pacing . Epinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium . He had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax   cardiac tamponade   and pulmonary embolism . During the resuscitation afterwards   it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest   so initially neo-decompression was attempted in the right chest . There was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression   and a right chest tube was placed . During this time   a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back . A left anterior thoracotomy was made by the Cardiac Surgery fellow who was present . After 30 minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage   there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors . Resuscitation was terminated at 1914 on 08-27 . After the termination of resuscitation   both the anesthesia Intensive Care Unit attending and the surgical attending were present to discuss the proceedings events with the patient s family members including his next of kin   his mother . Permission for a postmortem examination was granted . Matthew M. Barnett   M.D. 78 -102 Dictated By  Mark D.

 Cardiac arrest  His arrest was of unknown etiology at the time of admission . No further history was ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his hospitalization . CT angiogram had been negative for pulmonary embolism . The patient had an echocardiogram on 2013-04-26   which showed a normal ejection fraction and trivial mitral regurgitation  otherwise no obvious abnormalities were seen . Given the patient had an out of hospital arrest   remained unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability   he was treated with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body temperature to 32 degrees Celsius for a period of twelve hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent six hours . This was done   however   as in problem number two below   we were not successful in any neurologic recovery . Neurology  The patient remained unresponsive after the induced hypothermia   the patient was noticed to develop myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids . Electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing persistent seizure activity . Neurology was consulted and the patient was treated very aggressively   loaded with multiple drugs   including Ativan and Propofol drips . The patient continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this . He was loaded with Dilantin and ultimately was treated with a Pentobarb coma . After multiple attempts of weaning the Pentobarb   the patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was never able to be suppressed . Infectious disease  Over the course of his hospital stay   the patient s white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17 . Multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately found to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia   pneumonia   and urinary tract infection . For all these infections   the patient was treated with Vancomycin and he was also on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission . Blood cultures cleared by 2013-05-03 . Sputum culture as late as 2013-05-10   however was still positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus . The patient remained gravely ill throughout his hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his family with his son being his next of kin . Ultimately it was decided that the patient s wishes would be to not be maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only . With these goals of care   the patient expired on 2013-05-11 . The family did consent to a postmortem examination . DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES  Cardiac arrest .

IDENTIFYING DATA  The patient is a 66 year old Portuguese speaking gentleman with a history of hypertension   diabetes mellitus   increasing cholesterol   and history of tobacco use   who is status post myocardial infarction in September of 1993 and February of 1993   who presented with new onset of left chest pain and arm pain for two days . Apparently   patient was in his usual state of health until two days prior to admission when he noted new onset of chest pain and arm pain   confined to his left side . The chest pain was considered mild but persistent with episodes lasting twenty minutes . He came to the emergency room with chest pain on July 22   1994   relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin . No history of nausea and vomiting or shortness of breath . Denies fevers   pleuritic chest pain or cough . The electrocardiogram showed pseudonormalization of T waves in V1 through V6 and Q waves in V1 through V3 . The patient &aposs past cardiac history is significant for an anterior myocardial infarction in September of 1993 and a non-Q wave myocardial infarction in February of 1993 . The patient in September of 1993 had 3-4 millimeter ST segment elevation in V1 through V4 and depression in II   III   and AVF . At the time   patient had bright red blood per rectum as well and patient had cardiac catheterization at the time which showed 95 left anterior descending   which was percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied and had intra-aortic balloon pump placement . He had a CPK of over 5000 with MB fraction of 26.7 . The echocardiogram showed a 44 ejection fraction with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis . He had a positive exercise tolerance test with Thallium and repeat cardiac catheterization showed left anterior descending being patent and distal posterior descending artery lesion with circumflex lesion after the obtuse marginal 1 . In February of 1993   patient again presented with chest pain   shortness of breath   ruled in for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with CPK peak of 219 and MB of 20.9 . Repeat cardiac catheterization showed re-stenosis of proximal left anterior descending that had been percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied and a lesion in the first obtuse marginal and a moderate to severe left circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal . He also had an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle . CARDIAC RISK FACTORS  Again   patient &aposs cardiac risk factors include hypertension   diabetes mellitus   increasing cholesterol and a positive family history and tobacco use . In the past   patient had been noted to be non-compliant with cardiac medications and continues to smoke .,0,

 Dr. Jescdrig was called and a consultation was done and he placed bilateral ureteral stents in her kidneys . Postoperatively   she diuresed very well . She had dropped her BUN and creatinine to normal and she was found to have may be metastatic disease to her skin on the right paraumbilical area . Because of her age and mental condition and the fact that she had cerebral atrophy   the decision was made for comfort unless she has any further problem and no further chemotherapy or treatment will be given . The possibility that she may need to receive radiation therapy to this area to prevent her from getting further obstruction was also brought up . Her family felt that at the present time   because her condition was no good   they would like to just take her home so that she could enjoy the quality of life . Indeed   at the time of discharge she was conscious and she was cooperative and she was able to communicate very nicely with everyone including her family   except for the mental instability that she had because of her cerebral atrophy due to senility .

Chest and pelvis X-rays were negative for fractures  A CT of her head demonstrated intraparenchymal and extraaxial blood  mostly subarachnoid  in bilateral cerebral hemispheres   right greater than left   in a pattern indicating contrecoup injury .  A CT of her C-spine revealed a possible fracture of right C7 pedicle  A CT of her chest revealed bliateral lung nodules and a right thyroid nodule .  A CT of her sinues revealed no fractures  X-rays of her right lower extremity were negative for any acute injury .  A neurosurgery consult was obtained  Our recommendations were to load her with Dilantin and then continue at 100 mg PO TID .  The orthopedics spine service saw her and put her in a C-collar  She was admitted to the trauma ICU .  A repeat head CT 12 hours after the first was largely unchanged  She was transferred to step down .  She was having some pain issues and morphine was making her  jittery  On HD 2 she was switched to Fioricet   which helped with her headaches .  A repeact head CT was unchanged  An MRI of her C-spine was done to evaluate for ligamentous injury   but this was extremely limited examination due to patient motion and the signal in the spinal cord could not be adequately assessed for edema .  As per CMED CSRU spine   the patient was instructed to follow-up in 2 weeks for repeat X-rays  On discharge she was awake   alert and orientated X3 with c  o mild headache .  She had full strength motor exam   no pronator drift and PERRLA with full EOM s. She was ambulating without difficulties .  On 04-01 she was seen by physical therapy was thought to benefit from acute rehabilitation  She had a head CT prior to discharge that showed resolution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage .  Follow-up in 1 month with neurosurgery for a repeat head CT was arranged  She was discharged on fioricet and dilantin .

 He was admitted and found to have a significant hematocrit drop from 33.8 to 24.3 . He was found operation be short of breath and was taken to dialysis for apparent fluid overload . His gastrointestinal bleeding issues were investigated with an upper endoscopy which revealed multiple superficial gastric ulcerations consistent with an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs gastropathy . He had been discharged on one aspirin a day with 20 of Prilosec b.i.d. The aspirin was discontinued and he had no further problems with gastrointestinal bleeding and a stable hematocrit the rest of his hospitalization . During the course of his hospitalization   he became increasingly lethargic . An extensive work-up was done for any metabolic abnormalities which was unrevealing . He responded somewhat to lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy . He had one positive blood culture for Vancomycin resistant enterococcus . In the few days prior to his demise   he was intermittently somewhat lethargic buton the morning of June 25   1999   his white count was noted to have increased from 8 to 13 000 . That day   he was found to be acutely short of breath with a respiratory rate of 40 and oxygen saturations in the mid seventies . He was put on 100 nonrebreather and his oxygen saturations improved to the low nineties . Nasal trumpet suction was done and he was found to have food like material that was easily suctioned out . He was also found to havesome pieces of toast in his mouth . Blood gases were done and he was found to have a pH of 7.2 with a pCO2 of 21 . Fingerstick glucose revealed a sugar of 12 . A stat panel 7 confirmed that the sugar was 23 and that he had a new anion gap of 40 . Repeat blood gas was done which was almost identical to the first . The family was called and came in to see the patient . An extensive family meeting was held and the family agreed that it did not make sense to intubate the patient and send him to the Intensive Care Unit . In the acute setting   he had been started on levofloxacin   Flagyl   and Vancomycin . These antibiotics were continued but the family decided that they wanted us to emphasize the comfort of the patient and pursue no further invasive measures . The patient was made do not resuscitate    do not intubate . At 230 on June 26   1999   I was called to see the patient who had expired .

 In summary   patient is a 53  year-old female with multiple medical problems and history of depression with intentional overdose of barbiturates   opiates   Tylenol   and beta blocker . CMED  Patient was maintained on insulin   D10 and glucagon drips to maintain her hemodynamics . This was achieved with good effect   and they were subsequently weaned off . Patient was able to be extubated on hospital day three . Psychiatry was consulted after the patient was extubated   and felt that patient had a high suicide risk   and plan was for her to be admitted to the Psychiatry service once medically stable . Patient s renal function remained stable and her CKs trended down gradually . Patient remained on suicide precautions   but was deemed not to need ICU level monitoring   and was transferred to the floor on 01-11 . In the a.m. of 01  08   the patient experienced episode of tongue biting   unresponsiveness   disorientation . Was loaded on Dilantin . Became progressively hypoxic and tachypneic throughout the day with respiratory rates of 30-40 with a max respiratory rate of 116   tachycardia to 120s . Patient subsequently was transferred back to the CMED CCU on 2017-01-13 for further monitoring . Patient s hypoxia was felt most likely to be caused by pneumonia . She was started on appropriate antibiotics . Etiology of patient s tachypnea was unclear . Initially   the patient s etiology of seizure was not quite clear   but thought possibly secondary to alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal . She received EEG   MRI   LP . Subsequently EEG was noted to have no seizure activity . MRI was suboptimal due to motion artifact and LP was unremarkable . Despite absence of seizure activity on EEG   patient was continued on Dilantin . Her delirium was felt possibly secondary to withdrawal versus toxic metabolic   but gradually improved slowly   and therefore patient did not receive treatment for barbiturate withdrawal . Her mental status   tachypnea   and hypoxia all improved   and patient was subsequently transferred back to the floor medical team on 2017-01-15 . While on the floor   the patient s mental status was noted to be improved back at baseline compared to that back to the CMED CCU   and she exhibited no evidence of barbiturate withdrawal . She was continued on suicide precautions with a one-to-one sitter   and plan was for psychiatric admission when medical issues had resolved . On 2017-01-16   the night float intern was called to see the patient as she was unresponsive . Patient unresponsive to verbal command   sternal rub . Pupils were fixed and dilated . Patient noted to be without corneal reflexes   spontaneous breathing   heart sounds   or palpable pulses . Patient was pronounced dead at 615 a.m. on 2017-01-16 . Patient s family was notified and declined autopsy . Given the sudden unexpected nature of patient s death   the medical examiner was contacted and the case was accepted . Of note at time of death   patient was DNR    DNI . This was initiated after several conversations with the patient s mother   who stated that the patient had desired to be DNR    DNI for many years   not just in the recent past . These facts were confirmed via separate conversations with both the patient s lawyer and her primary care physician .

She also had significant hydrocephalus . Follow up CT scan showed worsening of her hydrocephalus and she had a ventriculostomy placed in the Intensive Care Unit . She failed to improve following placement of the ventriculostomy and her poor prognosis was discussed with the family . The family at that point considering the multiple system involvement of her diseases   decided to make the patient DNR and withdraw care . The patient expired on 1  19  96 at 1135 p.m. The medical examiner was called and the case was discussed   and he declined autopsy of the case . The family was informed and all questions were answered . Dictated By  RORIEZAILA FERNE KOTEKAYSKOTEKAYSCOA   M.D. AV9 Attending  NAREA L.

 Miss Siehjesc is an 85-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for Parkinson s Disease of ten years duration   supraventricular tachycardia   and a history of colon carcinoma   who was in her usual state of health until 1130 on the morning of admission when she felt the acute on set of 5 out of 10 right sided chest pain with radiation to her sternum but not to her neck or arms or back . It was not relieved by 2 sublingual nitroglycerins . She did state that she experienced some shortness of breath  her usual anginal equivalent  and believes she did experience some lightheadedness as well   but denies blacking out or falling . While the pain was initially intermittent   it became steady at about 100 p.m. at which time she presented to the Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital Emergency Room and following this experience a spontaneous remission of her right sided pain . Since that time she has experience occasional episodes of the same focal chest pain but finds that it spontaneously remits . It is made better by direct pressure to the point and she recalls no factors which worsened it . She is admitted to rule out myocardial infarction .

GNR sepsis Upon admission   pt was febrile to 101.2 with U  A consistent with UTI . A CT abd showed 8mm obstructing stone   hydro with stranding consistent with pylonephritis . Her presentation was thought likely due to urosepsis given h  o foul smelling urine and in setting of stone w   hydro  pyelo by CT. The patient went to IR on 2014-11-30 given evidence of right hydronephrosis on imaging for decompression and drainage. Upon admission   she was treated with Vancomycin and Gentamycin and Flagyl . She was started on the MUST protocol with high dose steroids as well and a goal SVO2 >70 . She was hypoxic requiring 3L nasal cannula O2 . She subsequently developed hypotension with SBP in the 70s . She was transferred to the CMED where the patient was continued on the MUST protocol with goais of CVP 10-12   SVO2 greater than 70 . The patient was bolused with NS and did not required pressors . On the day after admission to the CMED   the patient was noted to have small oxygen requirement with 2L NC . Repeat imaging revealed evidence of mild pulmonary congestion which was thought to account for the patient s mild hypoxia . Given that the patient had been maintaining a MAP of 60 without fluids or pressors   her goal CVP was decreased to >8 to avoid fluid overload . The patient was continued on Vancomycin and Gentamycin while speciation and sensitivities were pending . Ciprofloxacin was added on 2014-12-01 for synergy when surveillance cultures were found to be growing again GNR . Gent and Cipro were then discontinued and changed to meropenem when blood culture sensitivities became available revealing GNR sensitive to Jacoby but resistant to both Gent and Cipro . Additionaly surveillance cultures were drawn daily and the patient was transferred back to the floor with no subsequent pressor requirement . Blood cltures from 11-30 grew KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE and 12-01 grew KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE and PROTEUS MIRABILIS both sensitive to the Meropenam which she had already been receiving . Urine cultures from 11-30 grew STAPH AUREUS COAG    and GRAM NEGATIVE RODS of two morphologies  not further speciated  . She defervesed by 12-02 and remained clinically stable with normal blood pressures until the day of discharge . At the time of discharge   blood cultures from 12-02 and 12-03 have no growth to date . She received a midline on 12-04 with a goal of 16 days of further antibiotic treatment with Meropenam  for a total of 3 weeks  upon discharge back to the nursing home where she lives . .  Right hydronephrosis  Given right sided hydronephrosis and GNR bactermeia   a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed by IR 2014-11-30 . The patient put out 1385 cc urine the day after placement   950 cc of which came from nephrostomy tube . The tube appeared to be functioning well   draining urine with occasional clot passage . Urology was notified about the clots and occasional blood tinged urine but they did not make any further recommendations . Cultures from urine drawn from the nephrostomy tube are currently growing > 100K GNR   possibly of two colony morphologies   speciation and sensitivity pending . .  Hct drop  On admission to hospital patient had Hct of 29.2 . In the setting of Right sublavian line placement as well as nephrostomy tube placement the patient was noted to have a drifting Hct   concerning for bleed   with nadir of 22.8 on 2014-12-01 . A CT abdomen was performed which did not demonstrate any retroperitoneal bleed . Hct stabilized to 24 for three days prior to discharge . This can be followed as an outpatient .

Hypoxia The patient on admission was requiring 3 L NC in the setting of receiving 2L NS and chest film which demonstrated pulmonary congestion . The patient was not diuresed but allowed to auto-diurese any additional fluids and is currently with O2 sats 97-98 on room air . As her BP remained stable she did not receiving any standing fluids but was be bolused as appropriate for a MAP   60 or CVP   8 with careful monitoring of pulmonary status . Patient had an echocardiogram in 2012 which demonstrated an EF of 60-65 . her O2 requirement by discharge was 96 on room air with no SOB . .  Steroid-induced hyperglycemia  At home   the patient received metformin and SSI . The patient s metformin was held and she has been maintained on SSI qid while in the CMED . As the patient appeared to be clinically stable   her stress dose steroids were discontinued and the patient was changed back to her home dose of Prednisone 40mg PO qd for maintenance with anticipated decrease in her blood sugars . Her Metformin was re-added 2 days prior to discharge as well and fingerstick glucoses on the day of discharge were 93 and 156   respectively . .  Hypothyroidism  Repeat TSH and Free T4 were appropriate on current outpatient regimen. Patient was continued on Levothyroxine 75mcg po qd . .

 Mr. Breath was a 32 year old previously healthy unbelted driver whose car was hit at high speed by a vehicle driven by an intoxicated driver . The patient was ejected and his vehicle rolled over   possibly over him . He was found awake at the scene   complaining of abdominal pain . He had a blood pressure of 60 systolic upon arrival of the Giles Min General Hospital crew . Intravenous fluids was given . He was paralyzed and endotracheally intubated   and a 14 gauge catheter was inserted in his left chest because of poor breath sounds . He arrived at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital at 0230 with a blood pressure of 86 and a heart rate of 170 . Large bore cannulas were inserted into the femoral veins   bilateral chest tubes were placed   and his blood pressure rose to 110 systolic after two liters of crystalloid . He had an ecchymosis over the medial right costal margin and his abdomen was distended . His hematocrit was 36   and creatinine 1.6 . The abdominal tap was grossly positive for blood . His blood pressure fell to 60 systolic as he was being transferred to the computerized tomography scan table  the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 0300 . At laparotomy   there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity . There was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding   a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding   a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon   and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma . Control of the super-celiac aorta was obtained   and both left and right sided &quot Mattox &quot maneuvers were performed . The retroperitoneum was opened   with vigorous bleeding resulting . This was controlled   necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava . The vein was divided and suture ligated . Bleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures . The tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired . The examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury  in particular   the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal . The patient was now very stable   and he was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit . The patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells   five units of fresh frozen plasma   seven units of platelets   and nine liters of Ringer &aposs lactate . An intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery Service staff during the laparotomy . Intracranial pressures were normal . That day   cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal . An arch aortogram was normal . Over the ensuing twenty-four hours   bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed . The patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak   decreasing SVR   oliguria unresponsive to Lasix    Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2   worsening ARDS   a rise in temperature to 103   and a serum amylase of 1265 . He was returned to the operating room on July 4 . Three liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity . Exploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels . Because of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in   it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux-en-Y drainage was feasible . Four large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed   and gastrostomy   jejunostomy   and cholecystostomy tubes   as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed . The patient &aposs hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid   so that he was no longer on pressors . However   upon transfer from the operating room table to the RICU bed   he suffered a cardiac arrest   which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest  the initial arterial blood gas was 32  88  6.92 . He was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the RICU . Continuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on July 5   and continued for most of the remainder of the patient &aposs course . Vancomycin   Flagyl   and Aztreonam were given for gram negative Coccobacilli  later identified as Bacteroides  that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods  Enterobacter  in his peritoneal fluid . He was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome . Total parenteral nutrition was started on July 5 . Initial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR   high cardiac output   ongoing acidosis   requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range  drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation . The patient was returned to the operating room on July 10   where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided . It was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads . The abdomen was left open   with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration . He was returned to the operating room on July 12   13   16   19   21   and 23 for packing change   irrigation and debridement . Tracheostomy was also performed on July 17 . There was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation   infection   and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas . The subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one   with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic  cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute  and catabolic state . On July 26   abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the RICU  this was repeated daily for the next three days . On July 29   the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support . His blood pressure gradually fell   and he died early on July 30   1993 .,0,
 Mr. Factor is a 76 year old white male with acute inferior myocardial infarction   who was urgently transferred by Dr. Lenni Factor for cardiac catheterization and possible angioplasty . His only cardiac risk factor includes hypertension . The night of Oct 14   1999 the patient developed chest discomfort associated with shortness of breath . On October 15   1999 at 6 AM the patient was admitted to No Verlmerver Medical Center . An electrocardiogram showed acute inferior myocardial infarction . Due to unknown duration of the chest pain the patient wastransferred urgently to the TGCHO for cardiac catheterization . Shortly after Aggrastat was started   the patient became pain free . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  Hypertension and gout .,0,
 Mr. Gach is an 80 year old man with aprevious history of coronary artery disease who was transferred from Linghs County Medical Center to Oaksgekesser   Memorial Hospital because of an apparent infected wound   including the PICC line in his right elbow and positive blood cultures for Staph. aureus associated with fever . He has a history of myocardial infarctions in 1981   1992 and 08  97 with thelast episode complicated by anoxic encephalopathy . He gradually improved but had recurrent angina requiring cardiac catheterization   demonstrating 90 left main   95 ostial LAD and 30 to 40 mid-LAD with an occluded RCA . CABG surgery with two vessel bypass was done on 11  18  97 . He was then transferred to Linghs County Medical Center . A PICC line was placed in his left antecubital fossa and on the day of New Years Eve he developed a fever of 102 and became lethargic . The PICC line site was erythematous . Blood cultures grew out 4 out of 4 bottles for gram positive cocci   which thereafter proved to be Staph. aureus Methicillin sensitive . He had no chest pain   shortness of breath or diarrhea . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  Includes ischemic cardiomyopathy with an echocardiogram done on 11  13  97 showing an ejection fraction of 28 and LV that is diffusely hypokinetic . OTHER MEDICAL PROBLEMS  Dementia   2 paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  3 hypertension   4 peripheral vascular disease with previous left femoral popliteal bypass   5 diabetes mellitus   6 chronic renal insufficiency  7 COPD   8 previous abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in 1981   9 benign prostatic hypertrophy status post TURP surgery in 1982 .,0,
 Mr. Hohlt is a 76  year-old man with a history of hypertension   hyperlipidemia and prior myocardial infarction with a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the right coronary artery in 2005 at the Cambridge Health Alliance . He states that he has experienced pain and tightness in his back radiating into both shoulders starting on 2016-09-02 . The patient denies shortness of breath   dizziness   diaphoresis   or nausea . The pain lasted for 30 seconds following pushing a wheelbarrow and resolved with rest . The patient denied any prior episodes of pain or any since 2005 following the initial episode of pain . The patient informs his primary care provider who referred him to the emergency room . He then presented to Mass. Mental Health Center where he was ruled out for an myocardial infarction by enzymes and electrocardiograms . The patient also underwent a negative evaluation for dissecting aortic aneurysm . On 2016-09-03   the patient began experiencing continuing chest pain of increasing intensity . He was treated with nitroglycerin paste and IV Integrelin as well as Plavix . At that time   he ruled in for an NST EMI with a peak CK of 412 and a troponin of 6.23 . Electrocardiograms progressed to inverted T waves in V5 and V6 . The patient is now transferred to Cambridge Health Alliance for cardiac catheterization . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  Hypertension   hyperlipidemia   IMI in 2005 .

 Ms. Less is a 79 year old white female with history of non small cell lung cancer diagnosed in 02  95 . She underwent a resection for stage I in 10  95 and treated with XRT . She presented to the hospital with a numb right leg this morning and underwent an emergent embolectomy .,0,
 Ms. Shuffa is a 73-year-old Portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via Med Flight to Verg Medical Center . She arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm . She initially presented to Brottlake Medical Center on 9  15  00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids . While she was in Brottlake Medical Center   she developed new onset stridor   and an ENT consult was obtained . They attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a  6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway . She was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest . Given these findings   she underwent a CT scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus . This raised concerns for a hemorrhage   and she was transferred to Verg Medical Center emergently . At the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center   she underwent an emergent CT scan with IV contrast . This revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm . However   it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma . She was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service under the care of Dr. Sccrookes .,0,
 Ms. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9  16  00 shortly after she arrived . This showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time . She was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator . The differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor . On 9  22  00   she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy . A biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma . The operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus   trachea   aorta   and spine that was full of clot . There was no active bleeding at the time . Over the next several days   the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator . She had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma . The ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level . Given these findings   she underwent a Sestamibi scan . The Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid . At this time   it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma . Dr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10  5  00 . She underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma   a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids   resection of a left upper parathyroid   and tracheostomy . She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well . Her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left . This required a chest tube . Her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count   normal coags   and no obvious source of bleeding . It was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest . However   we are not quite sure why this was occurring . She underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology . It turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology . In conclusion   by systems  1. Neuro . The patient became intermittently agitated . We have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day . She responds well to this . She speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks . She has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day . She has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits . 2. Cardiac . The patient &aposs blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic . This is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d.   and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d . She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated . For this   we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine . Her blood pressure responds well to this . Otherwise   she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization . The patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter . This has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center . Dr. Lenni Lung has been consulted . The aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm . They elected not to inject it with thrombin . They asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed . They have opted for conservative management given the size . 3. Respiratory . At the time of discharge   the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 . She seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100 on 40 FIO2 . Her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days . Her right lung field is clear . Her tracheostomy is functioning well   and we have had no problems with it . She will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated . We had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week . With the pressure support at 7   she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 . Her oxygen saturation has always been good . 4. GI . The patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour . This is her goal . She tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day . Last week   she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day . Stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin . These have all been negative . We believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea . Since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity   her diarrhea has resolved . She has been taking Zantac   and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range . 5. GU . The patient has had hypernatremia . She is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight . We believe her to still be total body overloaded . Over the last several days   we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube . We also have been diuresing her with Bumex . This seems to trend her sodium down . This will need to be monitored closely . Her BUN and creatinine have been normal   and she has always made good urine . 6. Heme . As stated before   the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation . She had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin . Before we removed her chest tube   we had to give her platelets . She had no problems with this . At the time of discharge   her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range . I stress that she cannot be anticoagulated . We have given her Lovenox in the past   and she continues to bleed . Therefore   she is on no DVT prophylaxis . She does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis . She has a Greenfield filter in place   and this is her only DVT prophylaxis . 7. ID . At the time of discharge   the patient has a urinary tract infection . She is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures . Interestingly enough   she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum . This is also sensitive only to Macrodantin . We do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time . She is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course . Her Foley was changed the day before discharge . 8. Tubes   lines   and drains . The patient has a tracheostomy   NG tube   and a Foley catheter . Her central line   which was left subclavian quad lumen   was removed on the day of discharge .,0,

Stable appearance of left adrenal fat-containing lesion consistent with a myelolipoma . Stable appearance of hypodense lesion within the caudate lobe of the liver   too small to fully characterize . Subcentimeter attenuation lesion within the lower pole of the right kidney   too small to characterize . 3-mm noncalcified pulmonary nodule within the right lower lobe . If the patient does not have a history of a primary malignancy   followup CT of the chest in 1 year is recommended to evaluate for stability of this finding . Brief Hospital Course  Initial A  P  71 y  o male with dm2   cad   chf   uc presents with one week of lower abdominal pain and 2 episodes of brpbr on the day of admission .  BRBPR - The patient was in the intensive care unit given his lower GI bleed . An angiography showed bleeding in two vessels off of the Minnie supplying the sigmoid that were succesfully embolized . The patient was transfused from a Hct 29 to 34 on the day of discharge . His coumadin was held during his stay given his acute bleed but restarted per his PCP with the guidance of GI on the day of discharge .  The patient underwent a flex sigmoidoscopy on Friday   11-02   which showed old blood in the rectal vault but no active source of bleeding . Given this   it was advised that the patient have a colonoscopy to rule out further bleeding .  The patient had a colonoscopy on Monday 11-05 but unfortunately   was unable to complete the study as his bowel prep was inadequate . Therefore   he had a repeat colonoscopy on 11-06 which showed expected mucosal signs of moderate ulcerative colitis   no polyps   w   8 mm ulcer at junction of distal descending colon and sigmoid colon .  Biopsies were obtained during his colonoscopy and he should follow up with gastroenterology for the results .  Ulcerative colitis - The patient s Asacol was originally held but restarted the day prior to discharge per GI .  CAD  CHF  The patient was restarted on his home regimen prior to discharge as it was held temporarily given his acute GI bleed . The exception is that per his PCP   Jason aspirin will be held for 2 weeks given that he was restarted on coumadin with his risk of bleeding .  DM-2 - The patient was maintained on his home insulin regimen .  h  o DVT  PE  Coumadin was initially held . It was unclear at first as to why the patient required life-long anticoagulation . After discussing this with his PCP   Leon was clear that the patient had had recurrent DVTs and ultimately a PE and his PCP felt strongly that he required long-term anticoagulation . His goal INR should be 1.6-2.0 . If bleeding continues to occur   consider V. Winchester filter .  Access - 2 large bore PIVs  Code - full Medications on Admission  Meds on Admission  1.

 Patient was admitted and taken to the Operating Room the next day on 12  24  09 where patient underwent an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair . In his post-operative course   patient was sent to the unit and was put on perioperative Vancomycin . Post-operatively   patient was found to have frequent aberrant atrial premature beats and some rare ventricular premature beats . His lungs were found to have decreased breath sounds with a question of fluid overload . There was a question of whether to start him on Quinidine versus beta blockers . An echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderate left ventricular dysfunction with hypokinetic and akinetic areas throughout the left and right ventricle . Patient was loaded with Quinidine and then started on a maintenance dose . Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm once on Quinidine . Patient was discharged from the unit on 12  30  09 and was sent to the floor . His digoxin was found to be elevated so his Digoxin was held for four days while levels slowly came down . Patient was restarted on Digoxin just prior to discharge . Patient also was found to have elevated LDH   alkaline phosphatase   and amylase prior to admission . Lipase was within normal limits . Ultrasound was obtained of the biliary tree which demonstrated no abnormalities . Patient was also found to have several complaints of awaking in the middle of the night with tachypnea and some bilateral chest pain associated with breathing .

 Patient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever . Workup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia   an MRI of the liver to investigate for focal lesion   with no evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report . Blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on November 20   with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus . A repeat CMV hypercapture   negative for presence of CMV . A repeat CAT scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of November 9   indicating progressive infection of Acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis . In the days following admission   there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of Acanthamoeba infection   suggesting progressive skin involvement with Acanthamoeba . Infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole   on which there was more existing data on treatment of Acanthamoeba infection . Pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued . Clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued   with emergence on November 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia   and fleeting confusion while febrile   prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema   with dural and   likely   leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons   concerning for early lesions of similar type . Idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis   and cyclosporine was discontinued . However   much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement . Most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive Acanthamoeba infection   even on maximal antimicrobial therapy . A single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on November 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia   resulted in a course of levofloxacin   for both possible pneumonia   as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis . Patient experienced steady decline   with persistent fevers despite all above measures   progressive areas of skin infection   more frequent episodes of confusion   and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion   in the setting of fluid surge spacing . On November 30   a family meeting with patient &aposs daughter and spouse   along with primary oncologist   Dr. Tomedankell Bile   attending physician   Dr. Mellerny Close   and house staff   was held to discuss patient &aposs critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin   sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy . Decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care   with priority on patient &aposs comfort . Pentamidine   itraconazole   Levaquin   acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued   along with other medications nonessential to patient &aposs comfort . DNR    DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect . The patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger   and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion   in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays . Tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency . Such measures have been continued through December 3   and patient remains comfortable through this time . This interim dictation to be followed by an addendum detailing end of hospital course .

 Preoperatively   the patient underwent chemo-embolization for his hepatocellular carcinoma . The remainder of his preoperative course was benign . On July 15   1992   a liver became available   and the patient underwent hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplant . His operation was complicated by severe coagulopathy requiring fifty-nine units of packed red blood cells   64 units of FFP and 34 units of platelets . Postoperatively   the patient continued to have a coagulopathy requiring re-exploration on postoperatively day 2   with findings only of hematoma and no active bleeding . Initially   the patient did well in the Intensive Care Unit   mentally alert   and oriented   however   he continued to be coagulopathic and was requiring large amounts of blood and FFP transfusions   with a resultant pulmonary edema . He developed renal failure felt to be ATN secondary to ischemia of his kidneys . The patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit for twelve days prior to his death . He had daily transfusions of FFP and blood   and continued coagulopathy . He also developed thrombocytopenia   requiring persistent platelet transfusions on a daily basis . His immunosuppression was OKT3 and Solu Medrol   and he underwent hemodialysis and ultra filtration to remove fluid . While in the ICU he developed seizures   requiring large amounts of intravenous Valium to break his seizures   and he was maintained on Tegretol and Dilantin . However   he became progressively more mentally obtunded . During the seizure   he bit his tongue   resulting in a large bleed from his tongue   which was sutured by the ENT Service   however   his continued coagulopathy resulted in bleeding from his nasopharynx   which could never be identified   and also upper gastrointestinal bleeding . Endoscopy never revealed specific sources of bleeding   although he appeared to have a diffuse duodenitis . He was started on Pitressin to try to control the gastrointestinal bleeding   but he continued to have severe bleeding   and became progressively hypotensive   with eventual bradycardia and cardiac arrest . He was pronounced dead at 349 PM on July 15   1992 . STA TITCHEGRIESESC   M.D. DICTATING FOR  KIVERL NA CANTSLEDDJESC   M.D. TR  wj    bmot DD  07  28  92,0,

 Shortness of breath  Though the patient denied shortness of breath on admission   a progress note from Norwood nursing facility suggested that the patient had been having shortness of breath and cough for approximately one day with difficulty ambulating   needing to travel in a wheelchair . The patient was afebrile on admission with a normal white blood cell count but had significant wheezing and rales on physical examination with a possible left lower lobe opacity seen on chest x-ray . The etiology of the patient s shortness of breath was considered a likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and the patient was started on Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers . The patient was also started on Doxycycline given the concern for pneumonia on chest x-ray . She was also continued on steroids given evidence of severe airway obstruction . The patient s shortness of breath was also considered possibly related to a coronary event and she was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction . The patient s enzymes were cycled and were negative . The patient s electrocardiogram performed on hospital day number two was concerning for 21 heart block and the cardiology consult service was contacted for evaluation . The patient was taken to the Coronary Care Unit late on hospital day number two and received a temporary wire . The following day the patient received a permanent dual chamber rate responsive pacemaker . The patient was transferred back to the general medicine service where she continued to exhibit signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and nebulizers   steroids and antibiotics were continued . The patient s respiratory status improved throughout the remainder of her hospitalization and oxygen was eventually weaned . Once the patient was transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit   she appeared to have an element of heart failure in addition to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . She was given 20 mg of intravenous Lasix with impressive urine output and improvement in her overall fluid status . The patient was eventually restarted on her outpatient dose of Lasix once her renal function improved to baseline and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of her hospitalization . Heart block  As noted previously   the patient s electrocardiogram was significant for a 21 heart block and cardiology consult service was contacted for evaluation . The patient received a temporary pacing wire on the evening of hospital day number two and on hospital day number three received a dual chamber pacemaker . Renal  The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.8   considered likely secondary to hypovolemia . Her calculated fractional excretion of sodium was 0.13 percent suggesting a prerenal cause . The patient s creatinine improved to 1.1 with hydration . Once the patient s creatinine had improved to baseline   her Lasix and ace inhibitor were restarted and the patient s creatinine was noted to be stable . Gastrointestinal  The patient was admitted with a history of gastrointestinal bleed with guaiac positive stools on admission . Her hematocrit was noted to trend down after transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells on admission . Given guaiac positive stools and her history of gastrointestinal bleed in addition to use of steroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation   the gastroenterology consult service was contacted . The results of that consultation and potential esophagogastroduodenoscopy are pending at the time of dictation . Hypertension  The patient had moderate control of her blood pressure throughout her admission . Her calcium channel blocker and ace inhibitor were continued . Hematology  As noted previously   the patient s hematocrit was noted to drop after transfusion with one unit of packed red blood cells on admission . Given guaiac positive stools and the patient s history of gastrointestinal bleed   gastroenterology consult service was contacted for possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy and  or colonoscopy . The results of this consultation are pending at the time of dictation . The remainder of the Hubbard Regional Hospital hospital course   discharge diagnoses   medications and follow-up will be dictated at the time of discharge . Justin Q.

 The patient is a 25 year old who has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then . Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis . He had a pericardial window . He had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer . He had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound . He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management . We discussed the risks with his family . It was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath . The family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50 chance of success . SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS esophagoscopy   bronchoscopy   pericardectomy   excision of gastric ulcer   repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on December 4   1995 by Dr. Reg Cranka and Dr. Win Shufffyfe . In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &aposs complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &aposs current status . 1. Neurologic and Psychologic  The patient is on Nortriptyline for depression . He is a paraplegic from T4 down . Otherwise he is awake   alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities . The patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease . 2. Cardiac  The patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure . He had a cardiac catheterization on December 1   1995 that showed no complications   elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension . The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal . A full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials . The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on December 11   1995 that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion   trace mitral regurgitation   normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64 . There is Doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation . There is trace pulmonary insufficiency . The right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on December 6   1995 . A copy of this ultrasound is also found in his records . The patient is on no specific medications for his cardiac condition . 3. Respiratory  the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest . These may be removed when the incisions are noted to be well healed . The patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge . The patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal . His medications for his respiratory system are Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours . 3. GI  The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy . The patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on December 25   1995 . This showed no communication with the intestines and was simply a sinus tract . There is no fistula seen . Dr. Asha Vengloan of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &aposs nutrition . The patient takes poorly his po. diet . However he is able to swallow and tolerate po&aposs . He just claims to have no appetite and has very poor effort with feeding . The patient is able to tolerate po. medicines . 4. GU  The patient has an ulcer on his penis that has been treated with dressing changes . It has been noted to be improving . The patient has a Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed . Until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes . 5. Skin  The patient has multiple decubiti over his body   in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti . Plastic Surgery was consulted Dr. Ca Shuff who saw the patient and decided that the patient is not a surgical candidate at this point . These wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings . The patient &aposs activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased . 6. Infectious Disease  The patient &aposs white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits . The patient remains on Fluconazole . His other antibiotics were discontinued . His most recent cultures are negative . The chest X-ray shows no evidence of pneumonia . 7. Pain . The patient has been very closely with the Pain Service here while admitted . He has been placed on Oxycodone 10 mg. po. q3hours as needed for pain . The patient had a PCA and several other medications have been discontinued . The patient has strong narcotic seeking behavior . The patient for sleep was given Benadryl 25 to 50 mg. qhs. and was not allowed any increases in his narcotics after weaning him down to just requiring the Oxycodone . A complete summary of the patient &aposs medications are as follows  Cimetidine 300 mg. intravenous q6hours . Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours . Senokot two tablets po. bid or Metamucil one tablespoon po. bid . Nortriptyline 25 mg. po. qhs . KCL 40 mEq. po. bid .

The patient was seen at Ph University Of Medical Center for problem regarding his constrictive pericarditis and underwent a surgical procedure to correct this . Followup cardiac studies showed there was a resolution of his constrictive pericarditis . The patient also had a gastric ulcer repaired at the same time . Other issues of the patient are chronic and most likely will be followed up in hospitals closer to the patient &aposs home . If there are any questions regarding his care they should be directed to Dr. Cranka &aposs office at Ph University Of Medical Center and we will be happy to contact any or all of the consultations concerned with Hauth &aposs care .

 The patient is a 28  year-old   gravida 3   para 1   at approximately 27 weeks gestation   who was admitted on 2014-05-12 due to increasing symptoms of congestive heart failure . She has known dilated cardiomyopathy with a baseline ejection fraction of approximately 25 . She had been managed as an outpatient during her pregnancy and was on multiple medications including Lasix 40 mg daily   Hydralazine 25 mg daily   Toprol XL 100 mg daily   digoxin 0.5 mg daily and Lovenox 40 mg twice daily subcutaneously . She also took albuterol on a p.r.n. basis for her asthma . She has known allergy to penicillin   vancomycin and erythromycin . She was evaluated upon presentation by the Maternal Fetal Medicine attending on call as well as by Cardiology . She was found to have symptoms of congestive heart failure as well as decreased fetal movement . Fetal monitoring initially on admission was appropriate for gestational age .,0,
 The patient is a 43-year-old gravida II para II white female referred by Dr. Ca Shuff for evaluation . She was in her usual state of good health until December when she was seen emergently for treatment of a perforated colon cancer . That area was resected with no evidence of metastatic disease . She has had subsequent CEA&aposs and scans which were negative . A tumor was noted on her vulva which was biopsied and revealed squamous cell carcinoma in situ .,0,
 The patient is a 47 year old patient of Dr. Laymie Fournier and Dr. Leebjescobe in Co In Saorlirv Frea   West Virginia who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in May 1992   at which time he was hospitalized at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center . He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus . He had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time . A CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts . He was started on aspirin . He has a family history of hypertension as well . He was also placed on Vasotec . A Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy . A thallium stress test showed tachycardia and severe dyspnea as well as a fall in blood pressure with low level exercise . An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis . Accordingly he was referred for further evaluation .,0,
 The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia who was admitted for autologous bone marrow transplant as per protocol 94-055 of the Santusli Hospital . The patient was originally diagnosed in 06  98 during a routine physical when he was noted to have a white blood cell count of 20 000   weight loss   and swelling in his neck and groin . He was watched after his initial diagnosis   but six months later he developed rapidly increasing leukocytosis and he became more symptomatic . After treatment with three cycles of fludarabine he had 90 involvement of his intratrabecular space . He was therefore treated with three cycles of fludarabine in combination with cytoxan . After this therapy he achieved a protocol eligible minimal disease state . However   he did have relative pancytopenia following this therapy . He was taken to bone marrow harvest in 08  22 at which time insufficient cells were obtained to proceed . He was returned previous to this admission for repeat bone marrow harvest and at that time he was given Neupogen prior to his harvest   and sufficient cells were not obtained to proceed with autologous bone marrow transplantation . His most recent bone marrow biopsy revealed less than 5 of intratrabecular space involvement . Recent CT scan showed no significant lymphadenopathy . The spleen was within normal limits .,0,
 The patient is a 48-year-old white man who is 20 days status post orthotopic cardiac transplant who was readmitted for sternal wound infection . He has insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and a history of a dilated cardiomyopathy . He had progressive symptoms of congestive heart failure which led to his evaluation of his cardiac transplant in March of 1991 . Preoperatively   he had a severely dilated left ventricle with markedly diminished function . His post transplant course was initially complicated by hyperglycemia and seizure on postoperative day number one . He was   however   extubted without difficulty and after that did quite well . He had a predischarge biopsy . He felt well at home without fevers   chills or rigors . There were no rashes . He had no chest pain or shortness of breath . When he was seen on 2  3 in the Transplant Clinic   his incision was noted to be more erythematous . He was referred to the Surgical Clinic where the wound was opened and the patient was admitted for intravenous antibiotics .,0,
 The patient is a 49 year old man who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit status post cardiac arrest . History was obtained per the Emergency Department report as well as from the patient s family . Information was very limited regarding the circumstances of his cardiac arrest . Reportedly   the patient was at a local restaurant where he was noted to be unresponsive . EMS was called and reported to arrive on scene within three minutes . The patient was asystolic but regained a perfusing rhythm after 2 mg of Epinephrine and 2 mg of Atropine . He was intubated in the field and brought to the Emergency Department . He remained unresponsive despite the administration of Narcan . CT examinations of the head   chest   abdomen and pelvis were all unremarkable . Initial chest x-ray showed a left retrocardiac opacity and prominent interstitium though his lung volumes were low . Subsequent chest x-ray showed right main stem intubation with left lung collapse which had corrected with withdrawal of the endotracheal tube . The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for induced hypothermia given his hemodynamic stability   ongoing unresponsiveness and recent out of hospital cardiac arrest .,0,
 The patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 . She was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever   chest wall ulceration   cellulitis and pain control . The patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass . A mammogram done in November 1990 was negative . However   mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses   suspicious for carcinoma . Fine needle aspiration on October 23   1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters . Staging evaluation included normal liver function tests   normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray . Bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally . Dr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4   1991 . The right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated   Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma . The margins were free of tumor   but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma . Furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer . The left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion . Estrogen receptor was 0 by ERICA . The patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage . Therefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast . Since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor   she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy . The patient was treated with CMSAP   which is Cytoxan   Methotrexate   Leukovoranrescue   5-FU   Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles . There were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression . However   following cycle 4   she developed a flu-like illness   followed by fever   nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion . ABGs showed a pO2 of 79   pH 7.44   pO2 33 . Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates . The differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis   Mycoplasma   Chlamydia . Basically in December 1993   she returned to the Hem    Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied . Although she had mediastinal recurrence   bone scan   head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease . She was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support . Complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis . She also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy . It was treated with gent and Cipro . Re-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis . In May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate   which required some red cell transfusions . In mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine . The patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 . She has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion   nausea and vomiting . We will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .,0,
 The patient is a 50-year-old female with history of low back pain radiating to both legs . She had increasing symptoms overtime   not controlled by conservative management . She therefore elected to undergo surgical treatment . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Her past medical history is notable for bilateral lower extremity venous insufficiency with edema   hypertension . She takes lisinopril    hydrochlorothiazide 20  25 mg p.o. q.d.   Vioxx 50 mg p.o. q.d.   Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.   Nortriptyline 25 mg p.o. q.h.s.   Neurontin 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.,0,
 The patient is a 52  year-old female with no known history of cardiac disease presenting with dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness   who was admitted for evaluation and management of her symptoms . 1. CARDIOVASCULAR  The patient was admitted for complaints of dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure which could be consistent with angina . However   given the long duration of the symptoms and negative workup in the past   it was thought to be unlikely . However   the patient was started on an aspirin as well as a beta blocker   and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol was initiated . A stress thallium was planned for the day following admission . However   on the night of admission the patient was found lying in her bed diaphoretic and obtunded   and a code was called . Further examination revealed a strong palpable pulse with a systolic blood pressure in the 130 s and a heart rate in the 80 s. Over the course of the next few minutes the patient became increasingly more responsive . She was treated with a fluid bolus . The patient quickly responded to a fluid bolus and became interactive . She reported that she was sitting on the commode urinating and began to feel nauseous and presyncopal . She was able to get to bed at which point she passed out . She denied any chest pain or pressure   and no shortness of breath during this event . A rhythm check obtained during the time of this event demonstrated a pause of six seconds followed by a junctional escape rhythm . An electrocardiogram obtained after the code demonstrated no acute changes . Her acute bradycardic event was felt likely secondary to her new beta blocker in conjunction with a vagal response . It was determined to stop the beta blocker   and atropine was placed at the bedside . On the following day the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated dilated right ventricle secondary to chronic dysfunction and a pulmonary artery pressure of greater than 100 . Her stress test was cancelled . A CT angiogram was ordered to evaluate for chronic thromboembolic disease as a potential cause of her pulmonary hypertension . She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of normal enzymes and continued to be monitored on telemetry . A Pulmonary consultation was obtained to evaluate for possible etiology of the patient s hypotension . There was little evidence to suggest any cardiac disease   and given the patient s Graves disease an autoimmune process was felt to be possible . In addition   consideration was given to sarcoidosis   human immunodeficiency virus   and drug-induced given her history of herbal medication use . It was recommended that the patient begin anticoagulation given the severity of her pulmonary hypertension . It was also planned to undergo a right heart catheterization with a vasodilation trial by the catheterization laboratory . A right heart catheterization was performed on 2014-12-05 . A pharmacologic pulmonary vasodilator challenge was performed with a positive response . In addition   a CT angiogram of the chest with pulmonary embolism protocol showed no intravascular filling defect but did show a right upper lobe ground-glass and scattered adenopathy . Therefore   in the end left atrial hypertension was essentially ruled out as a primary cause . Chronic pulmonary embolus was less likely given her negative CT angiogram . Chronic lung disease was unlikely given the patient s normal pulmonary function tests and DLCO in 2012 as well as a normal CT angiogram . Collagen vascular disease could not be definitively ruled out  however   given the patient s lack of connective tissue disorder stigmata it was thought to be less likely   and the patient s human immunodeficiency virus test was negative . Therefore   it was felt that the patient was most likely experiencing a primary pulmonary hypertension . Consideration was given to treating the patient with a course of calcium channel blocker  however   given the patient s poor response to Lopressor   it was determined that this would not be optimal treatment for the patient s pulmonary hypertension . Therefore   her insurance company was contacted regarding the potential of Flolan as a treatment .Plan,0,
 The patient is a 52 year old female with gravida 3 para 3 who presents with complains of abdominal pain and enlarged ovary by ultrasound .

 The patient is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history notable for coronary artery disease and CABG x2 in 2001 . The patient has felt unwell since 7  21 after his non-Q wave MI . The patient   at this time   was started on Statin and developed in arthritis approximately one month later with joint pain   myalgia and fatigue . No clear diagnosis was made . The patient was presumed to have a rheumatoid factor negative   rheumatoid arthritis and he was prescribed Naprosyn   prednisone and sulfasalazine . He had a CABG review in 2  21 . His first CABG was in 02  89 . Since 2  21   he has had increasing weight loss of 30-49 pounds   night sweats which he attributed to the prednisone and increased fatigue and myalgias . The patient has gradually taken to bed with decreasing activity . In late 7  22   sulfasalazine was started at one tab three times a day . The patient subsequently developed diffuse abdominal pain   nausea   vomiting   and decreased p.o. intake . A guaiac positive stool was also noted in the month of July . 10 days prior to admission   the patient &aposs primary care physician increased his sulfasalazine dose to two tabs three times a day . The patient &aposs prednisone was increased to 60 mg q.d. as the patient was diagnosed with an arthritis flare . The prednisone dose was gradually tapered to 20 mg q.d. The day before admission   the patient developed a fever to 102 degrees and increasing abdominal pain . He presented to an outside hops where he was noted to be leukopenic with a white blood cell count of 0.6   0 neutrophils   a hematocrit of 32   platelets of 326   a MCV of 79   and RDW of 22 . The patient was given IV fluids and treated with imipenem   transferred to Ca Valley Hospital ED   where it was noted that the patient had face and neck swelling   as well as erythema and cervical lymphadenopathy . The patient states that his swelling of his face began two days prior to admission and has doubled since then . In the emergency department   CT of head   neck and abdomen were performed .

 The patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from Pre Health on June 19   1998 to the Verg Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . On May 12   1998   the patient presented to Pre Health with fever   cough   dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung . She was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to Trovan and then transferred to A Hospital . On May 27   1998   the patient desaturated to 40 with a temperature of 100.5 degrees . Her oxygen saturations improved to only 92 on 100 face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit . Chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion . A VQ scan was high probability   but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75 . On May 24   1998   the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base   mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions . At this point   a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative . She was started on a steroid trial at that point . Her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy . On June 11   1998   the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed . The patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day .

 The patient is a 64-year-old female with 3-vessel disease who was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit Service for Western Mass . Hospital medical optimization and management following an aborted coronary artery bypass graft when a mobile aortic atheroma was noted . The patient was continued on aspirin   Plavix   and statin . Once the patient was titrated off dopamine   the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were restarted . With regard to the left ventricular thrombus   her goal INR remained 2.5 to 3  and the goal was to start heparin once the patient was stable from a thoracotomy and chest tube standpoint . The patient remained comfortable . By 04-01   on postoperative day two   the patient was doing well and the chest tube was discontinued . The patient still had transcutaneous pacing wires in place . Likewise   on 04-01   the patient was weaned off surgery without difficulty . Thus   the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were started to be titrated up . In addition   the patient was started on Wellbutrin for smoking cessation . At this point   it was determined that the patient would not receive percutaneous coronary intervention on this admission and would likely be discharged to the floor for stabilization with followup . The patient did well and was transferred to the floor on 04-02 . After evaluation and a discussion with Dr. Gunter   it was determined that the patient no longer needed anticoagulation since there was no aortic thrombus but only an aortic plaque   and there was no anterior  apical akinesis noted . At this point   the left ventricular thrombus  for which she was initially started therapy for  was no longer present . The patient was noted to have a slight hematocrit drop and was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for a goal hematocrit of greater than 30 . By 04-03   captopril and atenolol were started   and the patient s leg bandage from the vein harvest was removed . The patient continued to do well on the medical regimen and was without chest pain   shortness of breath   or any other symptoms . DISCHARGE DISPOSITION  Thus   the patient was discharged to home . DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS  FOLLOWUP The patient was to follow up with her primary care physician  Dr. Desmet    as well as with Dr. Gunter for an eventual percutaneous coronary intervention   and her surgeon  Dr. Halcomb  following her thoracotomy .

 The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath . He had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm . He was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health . The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q&aposs in V1 and V2   2 mm ST elevation in AVL   and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II   III   and F. On physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab . The cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7   pulmonary artery pressure of 29  16   RV 33  8   pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 . He had a 95 proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA &aposd to a residual of 30 and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed . He also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time . The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5 042 and 26.7 MB&aposs . His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems . He had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started . On day six   an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44 with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis . On day nine   he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II   III   and AVF   and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6   as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium . Therefore   he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM . The patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital . However   he did not keep any of these appointments . He went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months . On the a.m. of 10-24-93   the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath . He came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic . He was treated with oxygen   aspirin   five sublingual nitroglycerins   heparin   and was eventually made pain free with that regimen . CARDIAC RISK FACTORS  His cardiac risk factors included hypertension   diabetes mellitus   hypercholesterolemia   cigarette smoking   and a positive family history .,0,

 The patient is a 74 year old female with metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid who presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on 4  28  93 with progressive weakness   weight loss and shortness of breath . The patient was in a good state of health until January of 1993 when she developed a serious upper respiratory tract infection associated with weakness and fatigue . She had also reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months . Although her upper respiratory tract infection seemed to be resolving   her weakness persisted . A work up begun by her internist   Dr. Brain   revealed a white blood cell count of 49 000 with 50 eosinophils . She was admitted to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home for further evaluation . Data collected there included a chest x-ray which was unremarkable . The liver function tests showed an alkaline phosphatase of 303   LDH 310   SGOT 66   albumin 2.5 . A peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers . Chromosomal studies were negative . A bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of an old fracture   as well as in the right supraclavicular area . A thyroid ultrasound showed an inferior thyroid mass . This was followed by an abdominal CT which showed an enlarged spleen   a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst . Biopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid . An upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable . The small bowel follow through was within normal limits . A thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side . A chest CT also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly . The patient was subsequently referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital under the service of Dr. Brain . She continued to have profound weakness   a decreased appetite and weight loss . She also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion . A needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma . The patient reports no history of radiation exposure   no family history of thyroid carcinoma   no recent travels or exposure to tuberculosis . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  Includes a history of atrial fibrillation with good heart rate control on Digoxin . She reports no prior surgical history . The patient also reports no known drug allergy .,0,
 The patient is a 79-year-old man status postradical cystoprostatectomy with ileal loop for locally invasive prostate cancer . This operation was performed 2  11  02 by Dr. Doje Para . The postoperative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with transfer to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit . This transfer occurred around postoperative day 8 for anticoagulation and amiodarone load . The anticoagulation was stopped due to concern for postoperative bleeding . The patient complained of fevers . The patient presented to the emergency room on 3  7  02   complaining of fevers since Monday 3  2  02 . He developed erythema around the wound on Wednesday and was seen by Dr. Para   who started Keflex and obtained a CT scan which demonstrated a fluid collection at the site of erythema . The fevers continued as high as 102.5 degrees F with chills on the morning of admission . He was draining pus from the wound site with subsequent relief of discomfort at the site . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  Hypertension   atrial fibrillation   gout . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY  Cystoprostatectomy   bilateral inguinal hernia repair .,0,
 The patient is a seventy two year old man who a number of years ago underwent coronary bypass surgery at another institution . This took place in 1983 . In 1992 he underwent redo surgery and aortic valve replacement . In April 1994 he presented with an acute inferior myocardial infarction and was given Streptokinase . He had recurrent pain and went to the Catheter Laboratory where a proximal right coronary artery lesion was angioplastied . A relook several days later led to a repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . He has has stable   mild angina   subsequently   mostly in the setting of stress . Slightly increased in recent months . On the day of admission   he was involved in a minor motor vehicle accident   and there was some apparent controversy with the driver of the other vehicle   during the course of which he developed substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm and shoulder . This waxed and waned for thirty to sixty minutes   and he took a number of nitroglycerins . After returning home after conferring with his wife   and the pain lasted another half hour   he came to the emergency room . His electrocardiogram showed increased T wave inversions in V3 and V4 and 1 mm . ST segment depression in V3 through V6 . His examination was largely benign after he was made pain free . The pulse was 75   blood pressure 120  80   respirations 18   and he was afebrile . The jugular veins were not distended   the carotid volume was diminished . The chest was clear and the cardiac rhythm was regular . There were normal prothetic valves . There was a grade II-II apical and systolic murmur . The abdomen was negative and there was no edema of the feet .,0,
 The patient is admitted to this hospital through the Podiatry Service  however   the stress test showed multi-vessel disease . Podiatry continued to follow for evaluation of his left foot ulcer . At the time of discharge   he was having acetic acid wet-to-dry dressing changes   0.25 q. day . Vascular Surgery was following at the same time and decided that bilateral iliac stenting would be the most optimum treatment currently and suggested that the patient should be worked up for cardiac disease prior to re-vascularization . Medicine was also consulted at that time for high blood pressure and for the biceps pain . While having angiography   he had a transient increase in his blood pressure and became diaphoretic and thus precipitated the evaluation for cardiac disease . Cardiology was consulted at that time to evaluate his heart . The patient was managed on the Medical Service for his drop in blood pressure and cardiac evaluation . He was also followed by Podiatry and Vascular Surgery . He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory which showed multi-vessel disease and Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted . The patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2013-09-04   where a coronary artery bypass graft times four was performed   left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending   saphenous vein graft to diagonal   saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to PC by Dr. Wright . The patient was transferred to the CSRU postoperatively where he did well . He was slowly weaned from his ventilator and was able to be extubated . The patient was able to be weaned to six liters nasal cannula after extubation   however   it was noted on chest x-ray that he had a small apical pneumothorax . A repeat chest x-ray showed resolution of that pneumothorax . The patient was continued on an insulin drip for his diabetes mellitus but continued to improve . His chest tube was in place for a high chest tube output . His Foley catheter was removed and the patient was transferred to the Floor . Physical Therapy was consulted in order to assess the patient s ambulation and mobility   however   with his foot infection and associated pain   it was difficult to assess at that time . After arriving on the Floor   the patient had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone and Lopressor . The patient resolved   however   Lasix was also given due to some pulmonary edema and increasing oxygen need . The patient continued to have episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation while on the Floor   which required continued diuresis as well as intravenous Lopressor . His chest tube and Foley catheter were removed on postoperative day number three   and the patient had aggressive chest Physical Therapy and nebulizer treatments . His dressing changes for his foot continued per the Podiatry Service and his leg ulcer was noted to be slowly healing . The patient had multiple episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation which again required intravenous Lopressor . Amiodarone boluses were given and the patient was started on 400 three times a day of p.o. amiodarone   aggressive pulmonary toilet and continued diuresis was done   however   the patient continued to have respiratory difficulties when in rapid atrial fibrillation . The patient was evaluated on postoperative day number five and it was decided at that time that the patient should be transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory difficulties . He was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where he was aggressively diuresed as well as his rate was controlled and chest Physical Therapy and nebulizer treatments were done . The patient improved slowly . Also   his white blood cell count was found to rise to 32.0  this was most likely due to a secondary infection of his foot and Zosyn was started . The patient continued to do well and his recurrent atrial fibrillation slowly improved  p.o. doses of Lopressor slowly increased to get better control of his rate and the patient was able to be controlled with a heart rate in the 50s to 60s with Lopressor . Following initiation of his Zosyn   the white count continued to improve and the patient was planned for a PICC line for long-term intravenous antibiotics . The patient was started on Lopressor 75 mg p.o. twice a day with good control with a heart rate of 50s to 60s . He is in sinus rhythm . He was also started on his preoperative medications of Amlodipine and Losartan with improvement of his blood pressure . The patient was also reduced to 400 mg q. day of amiodarone . Pulmonary was consulted at this time for this difficulty of diuresis and pulmonary edema . They continued to agree with the management of the patient and with aggressive pulmonary toilet as well as diuresis and nebulizer treatment . The patient was transferred back from the Intensive Care Unit on 2013-09-13   and upon arriving on the floor   he continued to do well . Pulmonary toilet and aggressive chest Physical Therapy was continued and the patient was able to be weaned from his oxygen . Furthermore   his Foley catheter was removed and he was started on anti-coagulation for his episodes of atrial fibrillation . He had been started on heparin in the Intensive Care Unit and that was continued . Coumadin was then begun with a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0 . At that time he was stabilized from a cardiac perspective . Podiatry and Vascular Surgery were reconsulted to assess the patient s needs for revascularization and for his foot ulcer . It was decided at that time that the patient could be discharged in follow-up with Vascular Surgery for revascularization and Podiatry thereafter . On 2013-08-28   the patient had a PICC line placed for a six week course of intravenous Zosyn for his foot ulcer and his Coumadin was also continued . The patient did well and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility at that time . His discharge date is pending . CURRENT DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS  Regular insulin sliding scale .

RENAL FAILURE  The patient was initially thought to be prerenal   and his renal status improved after hydration and increased oral intake . He did have a magnetic resonance angiography of his kidneys which showed mild right-sided renal artery stenosis . His renal function fluctuated throughout his hospital stay   and when he was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit he did have decreased urine output in the setting of cardiogenic shock . CARDIOVASCULAR  The patient with severe peripheral vascular disease . During his hospital stay   he developed some nonsustained ventricular tachycardia . He also became hypotensive on 07-02 in the setting of infection . The patient had a central line placed and went into sustained ventricular tachycardia that was treated with lidocaine . After being treated with lidocaine   the patient became apneic requiring intubation and transfer to the Coronary Care Unit . His nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was treated with a lidocaine drip . It was found that he had elevated troponins and likely an ischemic event on the 07-02 . A repeat echocardiogram showed a decreased ejection fraction from prior . He had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease . Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted   and due to the patient s acute illness   they wanted to re-evaluate after the patient was extubated . The patient continued to have intermittent episodes of ventricular tachycardia . He was continued on lidocaine and eventually changed over to amiodarone . He was noted to be cardiogenic shock requiring pressors . Of note   he likely suffered a second ischemic event during his Coronary Care Unit stay . The patient did have a Swan-Ganz catheter in place and had a low cardiac output . The patient s family eventually decided to withdraw care   and the patient was extubated and passed away on 2009-07-12 . 2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE  The patient was initially treated with levofloxacin for a left lower lobe infiltrate and a urinary tract infection . He then developed positive blood cultures with Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to levofloxacin   and that was continued . When the patient became hypotensive and required intubation and pressors   his antibiotics were broadened   and he was put on stress-dose steroids . He was found to have bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia . 3. PULMONARY  The patient required intubation in the setting of hypotension and ventricular tachycardia . He was actually extubated on 07-09   but then reintubated one hour later due to hypoxia . He was also found to have a bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia . DISCHARGE DISPOSITION  On 07-12   after and extensive family meeting   the family decided to extubate the patient and make him comfortable   and he passed away at 520 on 2009-07-12 .

 The patient underwent chemotherapy on the following doses  IFEX 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days   MESNA 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days continuous IV infusion . She had VP-16 mixed with 250 cc IV fluid given over 1 hour each day for 3 days . She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX    MESNA were completed . The patient s urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid . Because it was felt the patient was bleeding and the patient was contaminated   she received her IFEX    MESNA . A repeat straight cath was negative for RBC s . After 1 day of chemotherapy   the patient had 8-10 RBC s in her urine but by the second day of her IFEX infusion   she had 50-80 RBC s in her urine as well as a few transitional epithelial cells . Because of this finding   her IFEX was stopped before completion of her second day of infusion . Her MESNA alone was continued at that time for IV infusion . She did receive her VP-16 without complication . Other significant issues were the patient s hematocrit on admission at 31.1 which dwindled down to 26.2 by 9-10 . The patient was counselled and received 2 units of packed RBC s at that time . However   the patient s hematocrit bumped only to 28.1 and a repeat later on 9-11   showed hematocrit of 27.6 . At this time   an additional 2 units of packed RBC s were transfused . The third issue was that her anticoagulation was grossly out of control on admission with PT of 25.6 and PTT of 42.2 . Her repeat on 9-8   was 36.0    68.2 and her Coumadin was held . She received no Coumadin during her admission and by the time of discharge   her PT was down to 16.2 . She was restarted on Coumadin 2.5 mg per day . The patient s hematocrit on the day of discharge was 35.6 showing significant bump in her count after her second two units of packed RBC s . Her PT on the day of discharge was 13.2 and she was started on Coumadin 2.5 mg po q d as mentioned . The patient was discharged on 9-12-92   with the approval of her attending physiciana   Dr. Porriede Friednantflirt . FOLLOW UP CARE  On 9-28-92   the patient will return for chemotherapy and she will follow up with her primary doctor   Dr. Jescspald   for repeat PT and Coumadin dosing on Monday   9-14-02 .

These culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on 12  16  97   which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours . This required a transplant nephrectomy . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  The patient &aposs course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias   possibly due to aspiration   and by hemodynamic instability . He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension . On transfer   the patient was not sedated   but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator . The patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space . A pulmonary arteriogram on 01  03  98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli   likely less than one week old   possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of 12  19  97 . An inferior vena cava filter was placed  lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative . The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately   possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome . The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation . The physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process . CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material . For the concern of a perforated viscus   the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on 01  06  98   during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation . The patient remained unstable . He was taken to fluoroscopy   where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum . For this reason   he was taken again to the operating room on 01  08  98   at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction   introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass   cholecystotomy tube   gastrostomy tube   and jejunostomy tube . The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy . Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation . The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology . There was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction . He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia   as well as for his abdominal process . The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state   thought to be the source for the repeated clots . Because of the bleeding problems   however   it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent   and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin . Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities   which were corrected appropriately . Nonetheless   Mr. Less continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid . He remained pressor dependent   as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance . His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion . He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment . The patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision . Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted . Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. Less condition was irretrievable . It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel . Dr. Cantsleddjesc felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful . All physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures . This was done   and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on 1  16  98 . I L.

 The patient was a 63 year old female with long-standing history of polycythemia vera   managed medically   who on a routine follow-up examination complained of left side pain and had an ultrasound that demonstrated a complex left renal mass . A computerized tomography scan demonstrated a contrast enhancing complex left renal mass . Metastatic work-up was negative . The patient presented for nephrectomy . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY included polycythemia vera . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY included appendectomy and bunionectomy . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Hydrea . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS was negative in detail .,0,
 The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula . The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 . She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe . This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present . Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable . She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 . She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids . A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe . She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then . A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  Bronchitis   asthma   carcinoid cancer   no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY  The patient is status post appendectomy   hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy   bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .,0,
 The patient was a 79  year-old gentleman found down at home unresponsive by his wife after lunch . He had an unwitnessed fall . He had no history of headaches or recent illness . He remained unresponsive when the ambulance arrived . Systolic blood pressure was reported 250 on arrival to the Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary Emergency Department . He was intubated and given Versed and Fentanyl . His GCS was reported as 3 on arrival to the Emergency Department . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  Hypertension . Status post coronary artery bypass grafting . Pacemaker implantation . Atrial fibrillation . Cerebrovascular accident . Previous intracranial hemorrhage . MEDICATIONS  Aspirin   Folate   Multivitamin   Amiodarone   Lasix   Imdur   Celexa   Lipitor   Potassium .,0,
 The patient was admitted   placed on intravenous fluids . He was continued on his imipenem   intravenously . The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition . On 4  17  95   GI Interventional Radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection . Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture . The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst . The patient was evaluated by Cardiology . A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct   involving the posteroseptal   anteroseptal areas . Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted  however   no ischemia was seen . An echocardiogram was done . The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function   with left ventricular aneurysm . The right ventricle appeared to be acceptable . The percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output . The fluid was sent for amylase   which came back 53 230 . On 4  28  95   the patient had new onset of abdominal pain . His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5   on 4  27 . A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed . Approximately 100 cc.&aposs of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter . The computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position . Because of the patient &aposs deteriorating state   the patient was brought to the operating room on 4  28  95 . An exploratory laparotomy was performed . The splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface . Thus   the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected . The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy   and oversewing of the descending colon . Drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done . The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well   and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit . In the Intensive Care Unit   the patient had a prolonged course . The patient was then extubated on postoperative day 2   but remained pressor-dependent . He remained on imipenem   and Vancomycin was also started . Thereafter   the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course . He was eventually transferred to the floor   where he remained meta-stable . He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic  40-50 diastolic . These resolved without incident . He also had repeated temperature spikes . After repeated work ups   it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area . His drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced   and eventually discontinued . Mr. Mass was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics . Most recently   he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin   ofloxacin   and Flagyl   for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods . This 28 day course was completed on 07  15  95 . The patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-B and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas   which grew Candida albicans . The patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with Torulopsis glabrata   going from his urine . He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this . Mr. Mass was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm . He remained stable from a cardiac fashion . He did have problems with po intake . He had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux . He was treated with a variety of anti-emetics   most recently Granisetron   with only mild success . He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course . By the end of June   it became clear that Mr. Mass would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis  however   long discussions with the patient and his wife   who was his health-care proxy   revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted . The patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay . Multiple discussions were held between Dr. Mass   the rest of the surgical team   and the patient &aposs wife   with this same result . After discussion with the patient &aposs primary doctor   Dr. Douet at Vassdiysey Medical Center   it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to Vassdiysey Medical Center . Of note   given the patient &aposs do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding   the patient &aposs Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .

 The patient was admitted and begun on cefotetan and Flagyl   as well as heparin . Her INR dropped to 1.6 prior to surgery   and her PTT was in the mid 80s prior to surgery . She was admitted and placed on a bowel prep two days before surgery and was taken to the Operating Room on hospital day  3   10  28  97 . At that time   she underwent sigmoid colectomy and ventral hernia repair .  A full account of this operation can be found in the Operative Note  . She tolerated this procedure without complications initially and was taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition . Postoperatively   she had her heparin restarted   and had a PTT rising to 142.8 and then down to 92 . Her primary postoperative development was the passage of some blood clots and blood per rectum on postoperative day  2 . She continued to pass blood per rectum and was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells . Her preoperative hematocrit was 41 and her hematocrit dropped to 30.4 on postoperative day  2 . This was a drop from an immediate postoperative hematocrit of 35.4 . Upon receiving the one unit of red blood cells   her hematocrit returned to 33   and in the two days subsequent to the transfusion   returned to 34 . Otherwise   her postoperative course was uneventful with gradual resolution of the passage of blood per rectum . Her heparin was discontinued when it was noted that she was bleeding per rectum and her PTT drifted to a normal range of 35 by postoperative day  3 . On postoperative day  1   the patient was restarted on 2 mg of Coumadin . However   due to the episode of bleeding on postoperative day  2   the Coumadin was held for two consecutive days   and then restarted on postoperative day  4 . At this time   she is given 3 mg and was gradually increased to her regular regimen of 4 mg alternating with 3 mg. The patient &aposs INR had dropped to 1.7 at the time of operation   and remained in this range initially   but began to rise to 2.0 with her Coumadin dosing . At the time of discharge   it was 1.9   for which she received 4 mg. On the next day   it was 1.6 and she returned to a normal dosing of 4 mg followed by outpatient draws to determine the further Coumadin dosing . This was postoperative day  6   at which time she is ready for discharge . The rest of her hospital course was unremarkable   with perioperative ampicillin   gentamicin and Flagyl discontinued on postoperative day  1 . She had some initial nausea but had no emesis . Her nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day  1   and she tolerated a regular diet by postoperative day  3 . She had flatus and regular bowel movements by postoperative day  5 . She also complained of some slight dizziness upon getting up . For this reason   her normal Lopressor and Norvasc were held . It was felt that this was re-equalibration after being sedentary and mostly in bed following the operation . She had some slight headaches which resolved with Tylenol   and the dizziness resolved as well . She was ready for discharge on postoperative day  6 . Her wound remained benign and was healing nicely at the time of discharge . DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS  Lopressor 50 mg q.a.m.   25 mg q.p.m.   and 25 mg q.h.s.   Synthroid 88 mcg q.d.

 The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative . She did not have any of her pain in the hospital . On the third hospital day   she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet . She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10  2  93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge . A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly . The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10  92 was still present . There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst   although this did not seem to be clinically significant . DISPOSITION  The patient was discharged to home in stable condition . Cultures were pending on her aspirate and will be treated with po doxycycline . Dictated By JIMCHARL B.

 The patient was admitted and pancultured . He was treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime while awaiting wound cultures . He had dressing changes twice a day . Surgery was consulted and followed him while he was in house . Cyclosporin levels were followed and his sugars were followed with a sliding scale . During the first two days   he required 14 and 22 units of additional coverage . However   by day three he required no additional insulin coverage . On the day prior to discharge   his intravenous antibiotics were discontinued and he was begun on tetracycline . DISPOSITION  The patient was discharged home in stable condition .,0,
 The patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions . He was transfused with 1  2 units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion . Because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated Leuco four units . The patient had a good bump in his hematocrit   more than expected from 22 to high 20 &aposs range next day after 3 1  2 units   but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1  2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells . He again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 &aposs after a total of 4 units   so he was given 2 more total units in 1  2 units segments the following day . His hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on 11-7-93 . The patient remained asymptomatic from a CHF stand point and felt much better after the transfusions . It is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data that is his LDH was within normal limits . In addition   multiple stools were guaiaced and were all guaiac negative . The patient was discharged with follow-up with his Hematologist   Dr. Eci Area and Rheumatologist   Dr. Taange Peter   and Cardiologist   Dr. Peter .,0,
 The patient was admitted and underwent celiac and superior mesenteric artery angiography which demonstrated a patent celiac and superior mesenteric artery with normal branching pattern . His preoperative workup was completed and included a normal white count   hematocrit 42 . normal electrolytes   normal coags and normal renal function . On 10-02-94 the patient was brought to the operating room where he underwent exploratory laparotomy and left hepatectomy and cholecystectomy by Dr. Duhenile . The patient tolerated the procedure well with a 2000 cc. blood loss and was autotransfused two units of blood . In the postoperative course Mr. Fyfe did surprisingly well given his underlying medical condition  He did require two units of transfused blood but otherwise did quite well and was extubated on the night of surgery . He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for two days but was hemodynamically stable throughout . He continued to manifest occasional premature ventricular contractions   but these were unchanged from preoperatively and the patient otherwise did well . His nasogastric tube was discontinued and he was begun on clear liquids and subsequently advanced to a regular diet without difficulty . Both of his Jackson-Pratt drains were removed without incident . By postoperative day  7   Mr. Fyfe was tolerating a regular ADA 1800 kilocalorie diet without difficulty with all of his tubes and drains removed . His wound was noted to be healing well and his colostomy functioning appropriately without significant difficulty . He is being transferred back to the Per Naplesspecrycet Hospital in stable condition on the same medications which he was on preoperatively . These include Diabeta 10 mg. po. bid . Serax 20 mg. po. qhs . Sudafed 30 po. bid . Theo-dur 300 mg. po. bid . Betoptic 0.5 one drop OU bid   Propene 0.1 one drop OU bid . Pred-Forte 1 one drop OS bid . Percocet two tabs po. q4h prn .

 The patient was admitted and was initially started on intravenous ampicillin   gentamicin and clindamycin . Her initial white blood cell count was 11.3   with a normal differential . Her sedimentation rate was elevated at 110 . Her electrolytes were within normal limits . She was maintained on intravenous antibiotics . On hospital day number three   her blood cultures came back positive in the anaerobic culture for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters . Further identification revealed staphylococcus coag-negative   which was sensitive to gentamicin and clindamycin . She was continued on her antibiotics   and was afebrile until hospital day number five   when she had a temperature spike to 102.3 . Repeat blood cultures were sent . Her white blood cell count was 12.8   with a normal differential . At this time   an Infectious Disease consult was obtained   and the recommendation was to discontinue the ampicillin   gentamicin and clindamycin   and start her on intravenous Unasyn . She underwent a pelvic ultrasound and an abdomen and pelvis CT   which revealed continued air in the endometrial cavity vs. in the fundal fibroid . Discussion was had at this time with the patient regarding whether or not this represented an infected abscess vs. post-surgical change . Extensive discussion was held   and second opinion was obtained regarding the need for possible drainage of the abscess vs. hysterectomy . The patient requested an outside second opinion   as she was reluctant to undergo hysterectomy at this time . She was discharged to home on hospital day number eight   on oral antibiotics . The patient was to have a repeat CT scan in one week . She was also to obtain a second opinion regarding the question of possible surgical management .

 The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer . There was no evidence of tamponade . An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted . Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox . Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed . She continued to have pulmonary wheezing   unknown origin   without history of asthma . Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma   induce sputum for CBC   arterial blood gas   continuing of the beta agonist inhalers   and trial of steroid inhalers . They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious   other cardiovascular causes   or viral bronchiolitis . She had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36 of predicted and FVC of 56 of predicted . Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45   pO2 of 63   a pCO2 of 41   and fairly significant AA gradient . She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on 06  14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination . Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 . EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade . She should have a follow-up echocardiogram . Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size   low normal function   moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures   and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &aposs cycle without any change in the effusion from 06  11 . Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time . She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing . She underwent her CT scan . This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest   question of pulmonary nodules in the chest   pericardial effusion   multiple liver metastases   decreased function of the left kidney   dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter   and periaortic lymphadenopathy . Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time . Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days 06  18   06  19   and 06  20 . She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06  19 and Ifex and Mesna on 06  18 . She was noted   on 06  16   to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest . Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne . They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient . The patient &aposs shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change . Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade . Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06  18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade . They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination . She had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06  18 originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 . The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex . She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex . Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis . She was hooked up with support services in Collot Ln   Dugo   Indiana 68961 for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety . She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06  22  91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .

 The patient was admitted for intravenous antibiotics and a question of evaluation of circulation to the left great toe and also possible debridement and possibly a toe amputation . The patient had the following radiological studies  08-27-92   left foot film   correlation   patient consistent with osteomyelitis involving the first digit and possibly the second digit of the left foot . The chest X-ray reveals no evidence of acute disease . The patient had lower extremity arterial non-invasive study which showed good arterial hemodynamics of the left lower extremity   perfusion to the TM level   but there was evidence of diabetic small vessel disease and spasm of his digits . The arterial circulation is adequate for healing of his left great toe ulcer   noncompressible left thigh and calf pressures highly calcified arterial system . On 09-03-92   patient underwent a left great toe buttontoe amputation under regional ankle block for chronic ulcer and osteomyelitis of the left great toe . The patient tolerated the procedure well . There were no complications during the procedure . There was a small Penrose drain postoperatively that was placed intraoperatively and discontinued on approximately postoperative day number three . The patient was preoperatively treated with about a seven day course of intravenous Unasyn and postoperatively treated for approximately four days of intravenous Unasyn . The patient was discharged home in stable condition on postoperative day number five   without any complications . The incision from buttontoe amputation of the left foot healing well   without any further complications . FOLLOWUP The patient is to follow up in clinic .,0,
 The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction . The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with CPK maximum on hospital day number one peak of 186 and iso of 23.8 and index of 12.8 on September 2   1994 .

 The patient was admitted to Vascular Surgery Service as a same day admission   and taken to the operating room for an uncomplicated endovascular repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm   and Anurx modular bifurcated graft was placed   and both common femoral arteries were repaired in the usual fashion . He had pulsatile pulse volume recordings   in both lower extremities   and both renal arteries were noted to be patent   as were both internal iliac arteries . His angiogram in the operating room   revealed no evidence of an endo leak . Postoperatively   his course was relatively uncomplicated . He did have an episode of a prolonged sinus pause in the recovery room   which resulted in transient loss of consciousness . He responded to a Neo-Synephrine bolus   and had no further complications from this standpoint . Dr. Rosean Fletcher   of the Cardiology Department was consulted   and it was his opinion that the sinus pause was related to increased vagal tone postoperatively   perhaps secondary to the epidural   as well as the patient &aposs Atenolol use . His Atenolol was held   and he had no further pauses during his stay . His postoperative CT scan showed no evidence of endo leak   or graft kinking . He maintained good peripheral pulses and warm feet postoperatively . However   he did develop significant ecchymosis in both groins   extending down into his scrotum . There was no evidence of significant groin hematomas . He tolerated a regular diet . His pain was adequately controlled with oral medications . Accordingly   the patient was discharged to home on postoperative day 2 . He will be visited by LDAMC for blood pressure and incision checks . He will follow up with Dr. Dye in the Clinic .,0,
 The patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin . Around 400 AM the next day an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted . Lung examination at that point showed good air entry   no wheezing   coarse breath sounds throughout . Neurologically   the patient was not following commands . Eyes were closed . He was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously   though less than before . Withdrawal to pain was still present . Both plantars were upgoing . A blood gas at this point showed a pH of 7.49   pO2 61   pCO2 of 33 on 100 non-rebreather mask . EKG showed sinus tachycardia . The patient &aposs temperature was 102 degrees . A repeat CAT scan of the head was performed . This showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere . There was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage . At this point   the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit . An MRI and MRA of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation . The MRI showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally   the right occipital lobe   the right thalamus and bilateral pons . The MRA of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries . The left vertebral artery was not visualized . There was a dominant right vertebral artery . There was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left . There was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries . Clinically   the patient continued to deteriorate . Neurosurgery was consulted   however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option   since even in the case of cerebellar swelling   there would be no improvement from decompensation . The patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management . Heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage . The aspiration pneumonia was treated with Cefotaxime and Metronidazole . The patient &aposs family was involved and they decided to opt for DNR    DNI in view of the poor prognosis . The patient passed away at 645 AM on June 12   1998 . CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  Deceased . DISCHARGE ORDERS  None . Dictated By  GREGSIS STREETS   M.D. SQ51 Attending  CHLINO B.

 The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital   on the Neurological Surgery Service of Lupevickette L. Ca   M.D. Prior to his admission   the patient &aposs gunshot wound was sutured close in the emergency room . The patient was placed on suicide precautions   and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid . The patient was seen in consultation by the Psychiatry Service   who began a battery of testing   which continues at the time of discharge . The Consulting Psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times   and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter . Allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended . From a medical standpoint   the patient did well . He was initially admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization . The chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of Captopril and Nifedipine . After his blood pressure had stabilized   the patient was transferred to the Neurology Ward . Close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen . The Psychiatry Service followed up extensively with the patient   and his Psychiatric progress is detailed in the Psychiatry transfer note . By the 7th hospital day   the patient was medically stable . He had undergone full Psychiatric evaluation   and was prepared for transfer to a Psychiatric Hospital . Therefore   because of his need for intense psychiatric care   the patient is discharged to the Vo Black Doylestrictshore Ft. Clinics Medical Center on the 7th hospital day .

 The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital . The patient was brought to the Operating Room on January 3   1994 where she underwent a median sternotomy with removal of her mediastinal mass . This mass was situated in the aortopulmonary window and was sent to pathology . The frozen section analysis revealed this to be adenocarcinoma   metastatic disease from the colon most likely . She had a chest tube placed intraoperatively and another placed postoperatively in the recovery room   for what was presumed to be a left pleural effusion . This tube drained only a small amount of fluid and it was likely that the effusion was made to look more severe in the presence of left hemidiaphragm elevation . This additional chest tube was removed the following day . Her postoperative hematocrit was 31   compared to a preoperative level of 43 . Her postoperative recovery was really quite remarkable . Mediastinal chest tube was removed on postoperative day three . The patient was discharged home in stable condition on postoperative day six . DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS  Percocet for pain . Follow up with Dr. Fede Duhenile . She will have a home health aide to visit and help her with meals . CA SHUFF   M.D. DICTATING FOR  FEDE LEVEL   M.D. TR  kw    bmot DD 1-9-94 TD,0,
 The patient was admitted to the GYN    Oncology Service under the care of Dr. Top on June 26   1994 . On that day she was taken to the operating room where she underwent an exam under anesthesia   an exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions   tumor debulking and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection . An abdominal wall hernia was also repaired . The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications . Her postoperative course was unremarkable . Her vaginal pack was removed on the second postoperative day as well as the Foley catheter . By postoperative day three she had return of normal bowel function and was able to tolerate a regular diet without any difficulty . Her Jackson-Pratt drain was removed on June 30   1994   postoperative day four . On that day she was feeling well enough   eating well   and voiding without difficulty . As a result she was able to be discharged home on June 30   1994 . FOLLOW-UP  She will follow up with Dr. Top in his office .,0,
 The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations . After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent . Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung . Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent . It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto . Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries . After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5   pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14   pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute   or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute . Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state . In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy   physical therapy   and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program . His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 . Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures . At a goal weight of 142 pounds   Mr. State &aposs filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home . The patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .,0,
 The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit . He was also seen by the Orthopedics Service and Neurosurgical Service . He went to the Operating Room quickly and had an intramedullary rodding of the femur and open reduction and internal fixation of the radius and ulna . He was evaluated by Neurosurgery for his head injury which showed multiple contusions in the frontal lobe . He was extubated on postoperative day two . He did have some blood loss anemia with a hematocrit of 20.9 . A repeat CT scan showed no change . He was begun on Physical Therapy but remained agitated . He was discharged to the Floor . His hematocrit remained stable . His cervical spine was cleared . The patient was seen by Psychiatry due to some delirium and question of suicidal ideation . He was also evaluated by the Neuro-Rehabilitation Service who thought that he had a post-head injury syndrome with diffuse cognitive deficits . He continued to have some episodes of agitation which were treated with medication . He required some sedation and restraint and was begun on whatever Physical Therapy he could have given his head injury . He was continued to be followed by Psychiatry and then was casted by Orthopedics . He continued to have episodes of confusion . He removed the cast that had been placed and then a long-leg cast was then placed so it would be difficult for him to remove or to ambulate on his leg   which might jeopardize his closure . It continued to be somewhat difficult to control his activity and Rehabilitation Screen was in place but there was difficulty finding the appropriate facility . His family was also involved in his care and orientation . He does of BuSpar   Trazodone and Haldol were continued and were adjusted by Psychiatry . He was continued on observation and sitters and finally became more docile and cooperative . He was continued on Physical Therapy and with his mother present   he began to follow commands much more appropriately and was able to be rehabilitated . He was finally sent home for home rehabilitation on 2011-02-23 . FINAL DIAGNOSES  Multiple trauma with severe frontal head injury . Open fracture of the femur . Radial and ulnar fractures .

 The patient was admitted to the Oncology Service on Founder &aposs 7 and received intravenous chemotherapy with a 72 hour continuous infusion of 5-FU   Vinblastine on day 1 and day 3   and Cisplatinum on day 1 . She tolerated the chemotherapy well with mild nausea and vomiting . She had mild increase in her hypertension during the hospitalization   likely secondary to fluid overload . She also had some modest anemia   at the time of discharge her hematocrit was 30.9 . Overall there were no unanticipated side effects of this chemotherapy . Following her recovery from chemotherapy   she will proceed to surgical resection .,0,
 The patient was admitted to the Service of Dr. Fede A. Duhenile . On 1  12  92 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent a neart total gastrectomy with a retrocolic Bill-Roth II gastrojejunostomy reconstruction . In addition a small ventral hernia was noted upon abdominal exploration within a previous surgical incision . This was repaired . A needle jejunostomy catheter was placed at the time of her operation to facilitate postoperative nutrition . With regards to the cancer   there was a large mass along the greater curvature in the body of the stomach   and several perigastric lymph nodes which were taken with the specimen . In addition   there were at least two lymph nodes within the porta hepatis which were dissected free and taken en bloc with the specimen . The remainder of her abdomen was unremarkable without evidence of metastatic spread elsewhere   including the liver . The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition . The patient s postoperative course was for the most part unremarkable . Her wounds healed well without incident and the needle jejunostomy tube was utilized on the first postoperative day right up until the time of discharge   infusing Vivonex T.E.N. The patient tolerated this without difficulty . The patient s nasogastric tube was removed on the 3rd postoperative day   and with the passage of flatus and good bowel sounds noted   she was started on a liquid diet which was advanced slowly . She was seen by the dietician and was advised with regard to needing numerous small meals during the day rather than 3 larger meals as she previously was used to . Her ambulation and mobilization increased gradually and by the time of discharge she was walking in the halls without assistance . As mentioned   her wounds healed well without incident and the staples were removed on the 10th postoperative day just prior to discharge . She had some difficulties with confusion in the early postoperative period which were attributable to her advanced age and a sundowning effect . These problems resolved by the 4th or 5th postoperative day and she remained lucid and alert for the remainder of her hospital stay . Surgical pathology report was completed prior to discharge which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ulcerating and extending through the wall into the serosa of the stomach . Metastatic carcinoma was present in 3 of 3 lymph nodes . The gastric resection margins were free of carcinoma . The patient was set for discharge on the 11th postoperative day doing well . On the day prior to discharge she complained of some dysuria   a urine specimen was obtained   which showed numerous white cells consistent with a urinary tract infection . She was started empirically on Bactrim   while culture and sensitivity results were pending and remained pending at the time of this dictation . She will be discharged to home and will be seen in follow-up by her regular physicians as well as Dr. Ko .,0,
 The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol . He was treated with aspirin   heparin   and intravenous nitroglycerin . No beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110  70 . The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9 MB fraction . This was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes . on 10-27-93   the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions   a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA &aposd   a lesion in the first OM   and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 . The left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle . Given the results of this cardiac catheterization   which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA   it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient . He was ambulated progressively on the floor . A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid . The patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath . On 11-2-93   the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging . This treadmill test was done on medications   including beta blockers   in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment . The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol   however   he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade . There were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test   although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II   III   and AVF . The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain . Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle . There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test . These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 . After extensive discussion between myself   Dr. Amesin   and Dr. Scgach   it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management . The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery   although he understands that this may become necessary in the future . Dr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient &aposs daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient &aposs compliance . Previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments . The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient . She will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside . The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization . Despite being on heparin for a short time   his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done . He will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future . CAGHALA UINTEELE   M.D. TR  yf    bmot DD  11-3-93 TD  11  04  93 CC,0,
 The patient was admitted to the Tau Memorial Hospital . She was seen by Dr. Freiermthalskush of the renal service for management of her chronic renal insufficiency . On 02  22   she underwent angiography   which revealed minimal right internal carotid artery disease   and proximal left internal carotid artery stenosis   2 cm in length for the 1 mm residual lumen . The left anterior communicating artery fell from the right . She was also seen by Cardiology   and she underwent cardiac catheterization   as part of her preop evaluation   which revealed normal resting hemodynamics   and a moderate posterior descending artery   and obtuse marginal stenoses . She was   therefore   cleared for the operating room   and on 3  3  92   she underwent a left carotid endarterectomy   with continuous electroencephalogram monitoring and vein patch angioplasty   which was uneventful . Her postoperative course was marked only by prolonged ileus   perhaps secondary to constipation   with persistent vomiting   requiring intravenous fluids   however   on 03  07  92   she had a large bowel movement   after aggressive bowel regime   felt significantly better   was able to tolerate PO &aposs . She is now able to be discharged home on her admission medications   with the exception of the fact that Vasotec was increased to 10 mg PO bid .

 The patient was admitted to the Verg Medical Center . Subsequent exercise treadmill test demonstrated no evidence of ischemia by EKG . The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room where he underwent a reoperative coronary artery bypass graft times three with a subaortic proximal graft from the aorta to the OM1 and then OM2 and aorta to the LAD with a wide graft per Dr. Lumar Jongguild . Postoperatively   the patient was ventilated . The patient was weaned off an Epinephrine drip . Rhythm became more stable . Balloon was weaned and finally discontinued . The patient was extubated . His Melranon was weaned off and his ACE inhibitor began . The patient was started on Amiodarone and diuresed . The patient &aposs lower extremities began to swell and the patient was begun on Hirudin for deep venous thrombosis . The patient &aposs heparin induced thrombocytopenia became positive and so he is allergic to heparin . The patient was begun on Coumadin and he stayed several days for Coumadinization and was finally discharged on therapeutic Coumadin . The patient tolerated a regular diet on postoperative day number thirteen from his reoperative coronary artery bypass graft .,0,
 The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea   with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin   although cultures never revealed a source for this . He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone . His headache improved   but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding   while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count   presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . Amicar was of uncertain value   but used intermittently . A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia   and given his other underlying medical problems   we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine   which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1 000   and his spleen shrank noticeably   but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid   for his hydrea   although we kept him on Allopurinol . The renal function deteriorated somewhat   hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin . The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization   providing him with some food and constant attention   while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused   and as his respiratory status deteriorated   the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine   he ultimately expired on 2  28  94 with the family present . No autopsy was obtained . LENNI BREUTZOLN   M.D. TR  lj    bmot DD  3  12  94 TD,0,
 The patient was admitted to the hospital and received two units of packed red blood cells for her hematocrit of 26   and had a magnesium repleted . The patient received three days of chemotherapy   consisting of 45 mg. of Cisplatin 160 mg. of VP 16   and tolerated chemotherapy resonably well . Serial PTs were obtained   and the patient was noted to have an initial PT of 10.9 on admission   despite Coumadin at home . She was given 10 mg. on hospital day  1   and 5 mg. on hospital day 2   and back to 2.5 qhs . The patient &aposs pro time bumped to 19.5 on hospital day  3   and the patient was instructed to continue with 2 1  2 mg. qhs and is to followup with Anticoagulation Clinic in one week for further pro time checks and adjustments . The patient did develop some hypertension during infusion of her VP 16 to the 170  100 range   which apparently happened during her prior chemotherapy . The patient was instructed to followup with her internist regarding further evaluation of her hypertension   and should be assessed regarding further management   as an inpatient   or while receiving chemotherapy .,0,
 The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute and chronic shortness of breath . 1. Cardiovascular  The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension . The patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension . She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes . On admission   she was diuresed with Lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days . The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 . She was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge . Her lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110   triglycerides 59   HDL32 LDL 64 . The patient had a D-dimer greater than 1000 with lower extremity non-invasive studies which were positive for a small right common femoral clot . It was unclear whether this was old or new . A TTE showed an ejection fraction of 60   mild mitral regurgitation   left atrial enlargement   mild tricuspid regurgitation   pulmonary artery pressures of 44 plus right atrial pressure . There was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale . Chest CT was a poor study but did not show a pulmonary embolus . The patient had subsequent dobutamine MIBI which was positive for inducible ischemia in the distribution of posterior descending coronary artery and posterolateral coronary artery with a small to medium perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall which was partially reversible . The cardiology service saw the patient and recommended medical management only without catheterization . Her blood pressure was high so Captopril was titrated up to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. . She will be discharged on Lisinopril with further titration as an outpatient . She is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day . Her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate . She is on an aspirin . She will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema . 2. Pulmonary  Pulmonary hypertension as seen on echocardiogram . Unclear whether there are chronic pulmonary embolus but did have positive test for deep venous thrombosis and will be treated with Coumadin . An ABG was done which showed pH 7.34   pCO2 78   pO2 92 on 2 liters . Her bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range . She has severe sleep apnea and falls asleep midsentence . She has episodes of not breathing . BIPAP was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this . She will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital . The pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing . She needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen . 3. Infectious disease  Evidence for cellulitis on her legs   likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion . She was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement . She will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis . 4. Hematology  D-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen . This clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new . She was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer . Chest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus . It was a poor study . Heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then Lovenox was started . Her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge . She will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox . Discharge INR 1.8 . Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 . 5. Fluids    electrolytes    nutrition  Low salt diet . Low cholesterol   low fat diet . DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE  To rehabilitation . DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS House diet . No added salt . Low saturated fat . Low cholesterol . ACTIVITY  As tolerated . ADDITIONAL COMMENTS  The patient needs physical therapy to increase stability in mobilization . Need to try to control blood pressure . Can increase her Ace inhibitor as tolerated . May start beta-blocker at a low dose given mild bradycardia at atenolol 50 mg p.o. q day . Need to continue oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula . Needs anticoagulation for 6 months for right common femoral artery deep venous thrombosis . Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 . Should continue Keflex for 10 more days or as clinically indicated . Need to follow INR after Keflex is discontinued as expect it will change . The patient has severe sleep apnea and stops breathing during sleep . This is her baseline status . CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  Satisfactory .,0,
 The patient was admitted to the preoperative holding area and taken electively to the operating room . She underwent a living-related renal transplant in the right iliac fossa . The operation was somewhat technically difficult secondary to a short segment of ureter which was anastomosed over a stent to the bladder . Otherwise   there were difficulties   and estimated blood loss was minimal . She was taken postoperatively to the recovery room already making a large amount of urine . Intraoperatively   for immunosuppression she received thymoglobulin and Solu-Medrol . She was started on Prograf and CellCept in the postoperative period . She was also maintained on Bactrim postoperatively and did not require ganciclovir   as she and her sister were cytomegalovirus negative . The patient s initial postoperative course was relatively uneventful . Her creatinine   which was 5 initially postoperatively   slowly dropped over the next few days until eventually reaching a low of 1 . She did receive pamidronate on postoperative day one and received a total of four doses thymoglobulin . Her steroid doses were slowly tapered over her hospital course   and her Prograf level was adjusted to maintain therapeutic values between 10 and 15 . She continued to make good urine over the first few days and had her urine losses replaced with intravenous fluids . On postoperative day three   the patient had an episode of shortness of breath that was evaluated by both the Renal and surgical residents . It was found that she was in acute pulmonary edema and required transfer to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit . Her blood pressure at the time of this incident was in the range of 200  120 . Her electrocardiogram showed no specific ST changes   but there was some loss of her R wave progression laterally . Serial enzymes were drawn   and Cardiology was consulted . With blood pressure control via a nitroglycerin drip and fluid restriction   the patient quickly improved and a had a relatively short stay in the Intensive Care Unit . Throughout this time   her creatinine continued to drop   and there was no apparent deleterious effect on her transplant from this episode . Her beta blocker was progressively increased   and her nitroglycerin drip was weaned down . Two days after this event   she underwent an echocardiogram which was significant for slightly depressed left ventricular systolic function with severe posterior wall hypokinesis . This was a change from her prior echocardiogram and demonstrated evidence of a small myocardial infarction . Clinically   she did much better and her blood pressure was optimized prior to discharge . She was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day five and was stable on the floor for the next two days . DISCHARGE DISPOSITION She was set to be discharged to home on 11-28   on postoperative day seven . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE 1.

 The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of prostate CA   for fluid rehydration . Initially   the patient was begun on Bactrim for presumptive urinary tract infection and the initial course of his hospitalization   he took p.o. s poorly . The patient remained afebrile   however   and his electrolytes were within normal limits . By hospital day number six   however   the patient became febrile to 100.7 and repeat urinalysis showed 20-30 white blood cells and 1 bacteria . Antibiotics were switched to IV Ciprofloxacin and the patient defervesced  however   by hospital day number seven   the patient was found to be passing very little urine through his condom catheter and electrolyte screen and electrolytes from hospital day number seven showed a BUN of 27 and a creatinine of 2.7 . The patient was vigorously fluid rehydrated  however   by hospital day number nine   BUN was 22   creatinine was 3.5 . A Foley catheter was placed at that time with the recovery of approximately 800 cc of urine . Subsequently   the patient began vigorously diuresing with 4 liters urine recovered the following hospital day . Blood electrolytes were remarkable for a sodium of 148 and a potassium of 5.1 . The patient s fluid hydration from D5 one-half normal saline with 20 mEq of K to D5W and acuchecks from this time showed blood sugars routinely between 20 and 50 . The patient was given one Amp of D50 for each acucheck for blood sugars of less than 40 . Gradually over the course of the following days   the patient s electrolytes again normalized  however   as the patient continues to take p.o. s poorly   the patient remained on IV hydration therapy . On hospital day number fourteen   electrolytes were sodium of 140   potassium 3.9   BUN of 11   creatinine 1.3 with a blood sugar of 125 and a magnesium of 1.9 . The patient was taking 470 cc of liquid p.o. and is now in stable condition and ready for transfer to El Hospital to continue his recovery . DISPOSITION  The patient is transferred to El Hospital   still receiving IV hydration at a rate currently of 50 cc an hour of D5 one-half normal with 20 mEq of K . Should the patient s p.o. intake drop to below 500   the patient should be hydrated at 75 cc  hour . If the patient s p.o. intake drop below 300 cc per day   the patient should be hydrated at 100 cc an hour . The Foley catheter was in place and the Bacitracin ointment should be applied to the urethral meatus twice a day . Periodic urinalysis should be conducted to monitor the development of possible urinary tract infection . It should be noted that while in the hospital   the patient received an abdominal ultrasound which is significant for a grossly enlarged liver with multiple foci of cancer . The patient is discharged on Mylanta 30 cc with meals   Carafate 1 gm q. 6   Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until the patient regains full activity and IV hydration . The Foley should be in place until a follow-up appointment with Dr. Aarhalt can be scheduled in approximately one to two weeks at which time a decision regarding the status of the patient s urinary obstruction will be addressed .

 The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis   renal failure   disseminated intravascular coagulation   shock   hepatic failure   pancreatitis   and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication . He was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems . 1-Rhabdomyolysis . The patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis . This resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia . The patient &aposs creatinine kinase peaked at 56 160 with negative MB percentages . The aldolase was positive at 142 . This was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities . The patient &aposs urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion . The patient &aposs urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine . Nevertheless   the patient &aposs renal failure continued to progress . Over the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum . Much of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis . 2-Renal failure . The creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th . The urinalysis revealed 4 albumin with marked occult blood . Peritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4  11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm   Le   and Round . Subsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 . He continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization . 3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation . On admission the patient &aposs prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 . He went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage . The patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma   cryoprecipitate   platelets   and packed red blood cells . His DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent . 4-Septic shock . The patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization . He was maintained variously on Levophed   Dobutamine   Dopamine   and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support . Hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output . He had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses   lungs   and multiple lines . This will be discussed below . Further he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure . An echocardiogram on 4  12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations . His ejection fraction was 55 . On 4  16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8   cardiac index of 4.5   and an SVR of 5.8 . 5-Hepatic failure . His SGPT on admission was 2 520 with a peak at 7 680 on hospital day two . He had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time . He was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service . Given his multiple other medical problems   the direness of his situation   and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation . 6-Cocaine intoxication . Serum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital . Further   at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive . This is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure . 7-Pneumonia . The patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms . The first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus   treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin . He subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin   dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure . He was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily . 8-Pancreatitis . The amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 . Although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements . 9-Catheter tip infections . The patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension . These were treated with Vancomycin . 10-Anemia . The patient &aposs hematocrit was 33 on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization . 11-Coma . The patient   although initially minimally responsive   went on to develop a deep comatose state . A CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis . The lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient &aposs persistent coagulopathy . The patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis . Further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy . Despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive . Mid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome . The patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization . Nevertheless   he developed refractory hypoxemia   hypotension   and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .,0,
 The patient was brought to the Operating Room   on April 22 . She underwent a mitral valve replacement   utilizing a 27 mm . St. Jude prosthesis   and tricuspid valve reconstruction by ring anuloplasty . She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with good hemodynamics . She initially awoke after surgery   with good hemodynamics . She was transiently in sinus rhythm   but atrial fibrillation recurred . She was extubated on the third postoperative day   and was initially slightly agitated and confused   largely due to an Intensive Care Unit psychosis . She continued to improve   with mobilization of fluid . She was initially noted to have a slow ventricular response in atrial fibrillation   but this gradually improved over time . She was initially noted to be somewhat anemic   and received transfusions . Coumadin was restarted   and her anticoagulation came into range . She was ultimately discharged with a heart rate in the 90 s   and with resolving edema and a clear chest . Her MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE included Lasix   40   b.i.d.   potassium   20 mEq b.i.d.   iron   and folic acid replacement   and Coumadin . RIEMUND C. ALL   M.D. TR  dun    bmot DD  7  12  94 TD,0,

 The patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt . The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient s precarious condition . Over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier . The patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient s intermittent hypertension . The patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction . After lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient s family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft . This was obtained on 08  30  98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service . The patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08  31  98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection . The procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest . The aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein . The cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes . The graft used was a homograft . The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open . The immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient s sternum . The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition . There he continued to be hemodynamically stable . Of note   intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent . In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09  02  98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement . On that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient s sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound . The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications . A number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps . The patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition . At this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin . The Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters . Over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties . The patient s subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day   Captopril 100 mg po three times a day   as well as Procardia . The patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control . Subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service . The patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient s Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them . As per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin   Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage . However on 09  08  98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient s intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius . Given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well . The patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics . This was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty . At the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen . He was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well . He continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable . On postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger . Subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service . The patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint . The patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient s indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation . These drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient . Prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics . The patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress . As a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation . The patient s condition continued to be improved . Given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09  13  1998 . In consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics . CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  Good . DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS Diet  High calorie   high protein . The patient s treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks . The patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by Occupational Therapy Services Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital . The patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger . The patient on discharge is to have twice weekly Vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term Vancomycin therapy . The patient was instructed to return to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema   drainage   or increasing incisional pain . The patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills .,0,
 The patient was initially admitted to the medical service for optimization prior to his coronary artery bypass graft . The patient was given stress dose steroids on the day prior to his surgery . He was closely followed from his admission through to his discharge by the renal service for his transplant issues . On 2016-02-15   the patient was taken to the operating room and had an off pump coronary artery bypass graft performed with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending   saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and posterior descending artery . For details of this operation   please see the previously dictated operative note . Postoperatively   the patient was transferred to the CSRU for close monitoring . On the evening of postoperative day number zero   the patient had decreased urine output and was placed on a Lasix drip for diuresis . The patient tolerated this well . The renal service continued to follow close management of his immunosuppression . On postoperative day number one   the patient was extubated and awakened from sedation . He did well on this and his Levophed drip was weaned to off as tolerated . Over the course of his Intensive Care Unit stay   the patient received six units of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit . He otherwise had a fairly uncomplicated postoperative course . On postoperative day number three   the patient was transferred to the floor . On postoperative day number four   the patient was noted to have a low platelet level of 43 000 . Heparin induced thrombocytopenia antibody panel was sent . Other than this   the patient did very well . Chest tubes were removed when output was low . Pacing wires were removed . Physical therapy saw the patient and cleared the patient for discharge . Ultimately   the patient was discharged on postoperative day number six tolerating a regular diet   adequate pain control on p.o. pain medications   and ambulating well with clearance of physical therapy . DISPOSITION  To home . DIET  Cardiac and diabetic diet . CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  Stable . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE The chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally without sternal click or discharge . Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm . The abdomen is soft   nontender   nondistended . Extremities are warm   noncyanotic   minimal peripheral edema .,0,
 The patient was judged to be at risk secondary to her history of somomabodies and vaginal bleeding . Her differential diagnosis included ovarian cancer . The patient was admitted on July 9 to the operating room . She underwent an open laparoscopy   total abdominal hysterectomy   bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy   lysis of adhesions   Birch procedure   and suprapubic Foley catheter placement and Jackson-Pratt drain placement . The estimated blood loss was 300 cc . There were no complications during the procedure and the patient returned to the recovery room in stable condition . Postoperatively   the patient did well . Her calcium was followed daily and repleted as needed . Her Jackson-Pratt drain was removed on postoperative day number two . The patient had a temperature of 101.6 on postoperative day two . Her lungs revealed coarse breath sounds . She was encouraged to ambulate and deep breath . The patient was started on nebulizer treatment . The patient did well and her suprapubic tube was clamped starting on postoperative day four . The patient voided spontaneously . Clamping continued until postoperative day six . At this time   her post-void residuals range from 2 cc to 25 cc . The suprapubic tube was therefore discontinued . By postoperative day six   the patient was also tolerating a regular diet and passing flatus . A chest X-ray was performed secondary to the patient &aposs coarse breath sounds   however   the chest X-ray was clear except for a small amount of atelectasis . The patient was discharged home . final pathology revealed right Fallopian tube and ovary with benign paratubal cysts and adhesions . The cervix revealed squamous metaplasia . The patient was discharged home on admission medications . In addition   she will take Ciprofloxacin for nine more days . She will also take Percocet .

 The patient was medically managed initially and then underwent on 2013-08-09   coronary artery bypass grafting x2 and a mitral valve annuloplasty with placement of intra-aortic balloon pump . He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in relatively stable condition . On postoperative day 1   his balloon pump was weaned and the patient was transferred at 2 units of packed red blood cells . He also began to wean off the ventilator . On postoperative day 1 in the evening   the patient was noted to go into atrial fibrillation   for which he was controlled and started on amiodarone   after which he converted again to normal sinus rhythm . He was extubated during postoperative day 1 . On postoperative day 2   the patient was noted to be relatively stable . His balloon pump had already been removed and on postoperative day 3   he was transferred to the floor on Lopressor and amiodarone in normal sinus rhythm . On the floor   the patient was noted to do extremely well . Physical therapy was consulted and the patient was ambulating extremely well with minimal assistance . On postoperative day 4   he remained afebrile with stable vital signs on Lopressor at 25 mg po bid and an amiodarone dose . His left chest tube was discontinued at this time and his right chest tube was removed the following day on postoperative day 5 . Currently   the patient is postoperative day 6 . He remains afebrile with stable vital signs and the patient is ambulating to a level 5 with physical therapy and wishes to be discharged home today .,0,
 The patient was scheduled for an operative date on 2014-07-29 and over the next few days she was given a low-residual diet . She had her belly cleaned with Hibiclens one a day and once an adequate preoperative evaluation was performed   she was given a bowel prep on Monday afternoon and evening in preparation for an exploratory laparotomy on Tuesday   2014-07-29 . On the morning of 2014-07-29   the patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a cholecystectomy   partial hepatectomy   partial lymph node dissection   a colocolostomy   partial colectomy   and in addition a gastrostomy and a feeding jejunostomy were also put in place . Please refer to the previously dictated operative notes for the details of this surgery . Briefly   the surgery on 2014-07-29 revealed a carcinoma of the gallbladder with a cholecystocolonic fistula which crossed into the liver as well as metastatic adenopathy around the portal nodes as well as retroperitoneal nodes around the inferior vena cava and the hepatic artery . In addition to the gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy tube   two Belmont-Gardner drains were placed . The patient s pain postoperatively was controlled with an epidural catheter . However   the epidural had the consequence of causing a bit of a hypotension in the patient and the patient was admitted to the Surgical ICU for the first postoperative day . In addition   the patient had low hematocrits which required a transfusion of packed red blood cells . In addition   on postoperative day number two   the patient was transferred out to the floor and she was doing better in terms of pain control on a Dilaudid PCA machine . On postoperative day number two   interestingly   the patient was complaining of sensitivity to light from an unknown etiology . The patient s postoperative course was unremarkable aside from the photophobia . On postoperative day number two   an Oncology consult with Dr. Natalie Mcalister was obtained and follow-up appointments were scheduled with him as an outpatient . Following that   the patient was slowly advanced to clear liquids and to a regular diet once her bowels began working when she began having flatus . Her bowel function was slow to develop and she needed to remain n.p.o. until postoperative day number six . The patient was also given supplemental tube feedings to supplement her calories and caloric intake . On postoperative day number seven   the patient was tolerating her clear liquid diet and her tube feeds . She was started on p.o. medicines and her first Belmont-Gardner drain was pulled due to scant output . By 2014-08-09   the patient was tolerating a full solid diet as well as her tube feeds . Between the two of those   her caloric intake was sufficient for her to sustain herself . She was discharged to home with services including tube feedings for her home care . Therefore   she was discharged on 2014-08-09 in good condition .,0,
 The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Wire who felt that manipulation of the tracheal tube was the best approach to the air leak since it was a new trach and he was requiring such high ventilator support that it was risky to change it . He also felt that lung biopsy at this time was rather risky . The patient was therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the Pseudomonas he was known to have . The steroids were tapered . He was also begun on anti-Candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen . Because of the story of hemoptysis   he also underwent an exotic bleeding work up for such things as Wegner &aposs and Goodpasture & aposs . These results were all negative . He continued to require very high FIO2 . He was found to have a DVT by ultrasound . He underwent a trial of TPA followed by heparin . This produced substantially further hemoptysis and the need for transfusion . He stabilized from this   but on the fifth while continuing to have extremely ventilator requirement . In consultation with his family   it was decided that enough support had been done . At that time   therefore   ventilator support was withdrawn under the comfort measures of morphine . STAIN J.

 The patient was started on ceftazidime   nafcillin and Flagyl for concern of a soft tissue infection . Neutropenic precautions were taken . The patient had a bone marrow biopsy which showed myeloid arrest and probable neutropenia from a drug-related cause presumed to be the sulfasalazine . Over the course of the hospitalization   the patient &aposs white blood cell count rose from 0.4 to 6.3 after he was given G-CSF   a course lasting from 9  28  01 until 9  30  01 . After the G-CSF   the absolute neutrophil count was greater than 8000 . On 10  3  01   the patient had a repeat head and neck CT   which showed a right parotitis and left submandibular lymphadenopathy with some necrosis . No frank abscesses . The patient &aposs antibiotics were changed to clindamycin 300 mg q.i.d. and patient was also put on sialagogue . Over the course of the hospitalization   the swelling and tenderness and erythema have steadily decreased . Recommendations on antibiotics were made by infectious disease team   who was consulted . Rheumatology was also consulted for patient and after workup   it was believed that arthritis may be a rheumatoid factor negative   rheumatoid polyarthritis . Rheumatology recommended a taper of his prednisone to 20 mg q.d. and the patient will be followed by the rheumatology service . The oncology service was also consulted for patient and performed a bone marrow biopsy . Throughout his course during this hospitalization   the patient was also followed by the ENT service . The ENT physicians did not recommend any procedures   incision and drainage for his right parotitis or left submandibular cervical lymph node necrosis . The ENT team recommended watching patient in-house for two days after his repeat imaging on 10  3  01   and to continue antibiotic coverage with clindamycin . The patient had no positive blood cultures during his hospitalization and remained afebrile after the second day of admission .,0,
 The patient was taken from the emergency room and transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for airway observation . He was given three liters of IV hydration with good urine output response . His wounds were dressed with antiointment and Xeroform with the plan to take him to the operating room for debridement under general anesthesia and application of artificial skin . The patient remained hemodynamically stable with good urine output . While in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was put on delirium tremons prophylaxis with Serax around the clock . There was no evidence while in the hospital . The patient was taken to the operating room on 1  5  97 . At that time the patient underwent debridement of his facial wounds and debridement of his right hand and forearm with application of artificial skin which is the dermagraft TC . The patient tolerated the procedure well . There were no complications . Postoperatively the patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit to the burn floor where he received dressing changes p.r.n. The patient remained afebrile and other vital signs were within normal limits . On the day of discharge the patient &aposs dressing was taken down completely and evaluation of the derma graft was made . At that time it appeared well adhered to the underlying skin . There was no evidence of infection . The patient was screened by the rehabilitation facility and felt to be an acceptable candidate . The patient and his family agreed to transfer from Nimaconwood Valley Hospital to Ianehutche Medical Center . DISPOSITION,0,
 The patient was taken to the Operating Room the day of admission . He underwent a left bronchoscopy and lower lobectomy of the left side . The operation was subsequently complicated by a postoperative bleeding . The patient had to be taken back to the Operating Room where a repair of the left pulmonary artery was performed . The patient was then transferred to the CSRU   intubated   in stable condition . Vascular Surgery Service was also consulted . During the operation   the patient received 13 units of packed red blood cells   four units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of platelets with an estimated blood loss of 1500 cc . The patient remained to be stable on the floor with subsequent monitoring of hematocrit within a normal stable range . He is successfully extubated on 08-12 and hypertension transferred to the floor in stable condition where the Pain Service is managing his epidural with very good effect and he is tolerating a regular p.o. diet and is making adequate amount of urine . His recovery was essentially unremarkable . His epidural was successfully discontinued and he is discharged to home on 08-15 with instructions to follow-up with Dr. Cordova in the office within the next one to two weeks . He is discharged to home with pain medication which is percocet . CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  Stable . DISCHARGE STATUS  To home without service .

 The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory   where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82  40 . This lowered with IV nitroglycerin . Selective coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery in its midportion . He had an 80 distal left main   a 90 proximal circumflex   and multiple significant lesions in the LAD . His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis . The situation was reviewed with his wife   Sligh . She noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the Leigh and lives at home with her and his daughter   age 18 . It was felt that   because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion   he should be admitted for further evaluation . Indeed   he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin   and he was put on IV Heparin . He stabilized over the weekend . He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor . He developed epigastric pain on 07  31 which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent . He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time . He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes . Therefore   he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy . The patient was seen in consultation by the Electrophysiology service   Dr. Slusslashgodle   who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery . On 08  02  93   an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed  then   Dr. Thorebreutz took him to the operating room   where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting . He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD   a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow   and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow . A paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig . After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia . He was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated . He had good hemodynamics . He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats . His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit . He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service   who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus . On 08  05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171 000 to 54 000  this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed   when Heparin was discontinued   since it had been restarted after surgery   his platelet count rebounded to normal . Therefore   he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin . He remained in normal sinus rhythm . He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia   which were clinically stable . He had a right bundle branch block . He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction   but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors   Digoxin   Coumadin   and aspirin . Therefore he was able to be discharged home . He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias  these will be done in Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew .

 The patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. Suot N. Dragtente on 02-21-91   where a left radical nephrectomy was performed . At operation   there was no gross adenopathy or renal vein involvement   and it was felt that the tumor was completely excised . The patient thereafter had a benign convalescence   and was discharged on the 5th postoperative day . The oncology fellows from Venbonlea Health followed her course and recommended holding off on her Hydrea while she is hospitalized   and they will follow her as an outpatient and restart her Hydrea when her hematocrit is over 40 . DISPOSITION  The patient was discharged to home . The patient was discharged on a regular diet . CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable . FOLLOW-UP will be with Dr. Suot N. Dragtente and with her Venbonlea Health oncology fellows .

 The patient was transferred for cardiac catheterization . Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 45   right dominant coronary artery system with occlusive single vessel disease of the LAD . Multiple wires were used to attempt to cross the total occlusion   but were ultimately unsuccessful . The patient was continued on a heparin drip for atrial fibrillation . Cardiothoracic Surgery consultation was obtained and the patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2010-03-12 for coronary artery bypass grafting times two  LIMA to the LAD   saphenous vein graft to the diagonal artery . Subsequent to this   the patient was transferred to the CRSU for closer monitoring . He was deemed to be too lethargic and sleepy to be extubated on postoperative day number zero . The patient was extubated early on postoperative day number one without significant complication . He remained in atrial fibrillation . The EP Service was consulted regarding the patient s atrial fibrillation . This was his main issue in the postoperative course . He was attempted on multiple different drugs including Procainamide   Diltiazem   Esmolol   Sotalol   Amiodarone . The patient was kept therapeutically anticoagulated throughout this period . The patient was also started on digoxin . Ultimately   the patient was transferred to the floor and anticoagulation with Coumadin was begun . The patient arrived on the floor with medications as follows  Sotalol 180 mg b.i.d.   Diltiazem 90 mg q.i.d.   digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. While the patient was awaiting therapeutic anticoagulation with Coumadin   he spontaneously converted into normal sinus rhythm . The patient was found to have a resting heart rate of approximately 50 subsequent to this . In consultation with the EP Service   Diltiazem was stopped . After approximately 24 hours   the patient converted back into atrial fibrillation and Diltiazem was restarted at 60 mg q.i.d. The patient then had one more episode where he was converted to normal sinus rhythm but this lasted only a few hours before reverting back to atrial fibrillation . The patient was ultimately discharged on postoperative day number 16   tolerating a regular diet   and adequate pain control on p.o. pain medications   having no anginal symptoms and with an INR of 2.0 . The patient failed multiple attempts at cardioversion . DISCHARGE CONDITION  Stable . INR 2.0. DISPOSITION  To home . DIET  Cardiac .,0,
 The patient was transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management for acute GI bleed . 1. Gastrointestinal bleed  The patient continued to receive blood transfusions on the floor and serial hematocrits with serial INR checks were drawn . As he was receiving his third unit of packed red blood cells   the patient became tachycardic and short of breath . His temperature raised from 98.6 F.   to 101.0 F. He was shown to have rigors . The transfusion was stopped and the patient was given Tylenol 1 mg with epinephrine   100 mg of hydrocortisone   25 mg of Benadryl and Demerol 15 as well as Pepcid . He had emesis times three of 75 cc of coffee ground material . The patient also desaturated to the low 80 s and was started on a non-rebreather mask . His saturations improved quickly on 100 non-rebreather mask within 15 to 20 minutes . Shortly after his mental status changed  he became disoriented and euphoric and continued to be in this state for two more hours . After that period of time   his mental status gradually improved and he continued to receive his blood transfusions requiring a total of ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma to reach a hematocrit of 30.0   which remained stable for the duration of his stay . On admission   the patient was started on high dose proton pump inhibitors for prophylaxis . On Wednesday   11-25   an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and was significant for the following findings  Medium hiatal hernia   Barretts esophagus   erosion of the gastroesophageal junction   granularity   erythema and congestion of the antrum in the pre-pyloric region compatible with gastritis . Erosions in the antrum and pre-pyloric region   granularity   erythema and congestion of the anterior bulb and posterior bulb compatible with duodenitis . It was recommended by Gastroenterology that the patient is to stay off aspirin for at least four to six weeks at discharge to prevent further bleeding . 2. Cardiovascular  During transfusion reaction episode   the patient had an episode of tachycardia ranging from 134 to 158   for one to two hours . EKG during this episode was taken and showed sinus tachycardia  however   serial enzymes were significant for CK peaking at 1075   MB peaking at 114 and MB index peaking at 10.8   consistent with myocardial damage . The day following this episode   EKG showed loss of R wave progression in anterior leads and Q waves in leads III and AVF consistent with anteroseptal myocardial infarction . The patient s blood pressures remained stable during his stay . He had no episodes of arrhythmia on Telemetry . Cardiology consultation was obtained . The myocardial infarction was attributed to demand ischemia secondary to acute hematocrit drop exacerbated by tachycardia secondary to blood transfusion reaction . Further Cardiologic work-up was suggested as an outpatient at four to six weeks post discharge . The patient was started on Lopressor   Lipitor and Lisinopril . 3. After ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma transfusions   the patient s hematocrit remained stable at above 30 . His INR decreased to 1.3 at the time of discharge . He required no blood transfusions for four days prior to discharge . 4. History of pulmonary embolism likely secondary to frequent flying . The need for further anti-coagulation was discussed with the patient s attending   Dr. Coleman   and it was decided not to continue anti-coagulation due to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding . The patient remained symptom free during his stay in the hospital   saturating well in room air . 5. Endocrine  The patient was restarted on Levothyroxine soon after admission . His hemoglobin A1C was sent and it was pending at the time of discharge . 6. Single mental status change times two hours during episode of blood transfusion reaction . Was most likely due to multiple drugs administered during the episode including Demerol . After this episode   the patient s mental status remained clear for the rest of the duration of his stay . 7. Prophylaxis  The patient was sent home on proton pump inhibitors . His Helicobacter pylori serology was sent and was pending at the time of discharge . CONDITION AT DISCHARGE  Good . DISPOSITION  The patient was discharged to home on the following medications .,0,
 The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit after his therapeutic pericardiocentesis . He was hemodynamically stable and without any complaints . He was continued on his home cardiac regimen   but was started on indomethacin for post pericardiotomy syndrome . Over the course of the night the patient drained an additional 400 cc of serosanguineous fluid from his pericardial drain pouch . By the next morning   the degree of drainage had decreased considerably with only 60 cc drained over six hours . The patient had a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram prior to drain removal which revealed the following  A trivial    physiologic pericardial effusion one day post pericardiocentesis with no change from the study immediately post pericardiocentesis . The pericardial drain was removed without any difficulty . The pericardial fluid bag was removed without any difficulty with the decision to monitor the patient overnight and repeat the echocardiogram prior to discharge . The patient had an enlarged left pleural effusion which was noted to layer on a lateral decubitus film . We decided to perform a therapeutic thoracentesis . The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion   and 1150 cc of fluid were drained . A chest x-ray was obtained post thoracentesis which revealed a significant decrease in the size of the left pleural effusion . No evidence of pneumothorax . On the morning of admission the patient had a markedly improved lung examination with increased air movement in the left base . He denied any shortness of breath and had oxygen saturations in the 90 s on room air . He had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a trivial    physiologic pericardial effusion . The patient was without any complaints and remained stable . CONDITION AT DISCHARGE  Condition on discharge was stable . DISCHARGE STATUS The patient was to be discharged to home .

Extremities  2 edema to the knees . LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION She had a white count of 9.3   hematocrit of 37.7   platelets of 293 . She had a CK of 212 and MB of 21   and a troponin of 0.56 . She had a Chem-7 which was normal . She had an INR of 1.5 on her Coumadin . Chest x-ray showed right patchy opacity with a right effusion . EKG showed sinus tachycardia   borderline left axis   normal intervals   LVH   left atrial enlargement   no Q waves   no P-R depressions   no ST segment elevations or depression . HOSPITAL COURSE  1. Congestive heart failure  Patient was diuresed effectively with nesiritide and Lasix . Patient s weight on admission was 250 pounds   and on the day of discharge was 244 pounds which was back to her dry weight . She had lost the 6 pounds that she reported gaining in the four days prior to her hospitalization . Patient was continued on her Toprol   her lisinopril   and her digoxin . Patient s Coumadin was held for right heart catheterization and biopsy   and then EP study with ICD placement . Patient did have Woodrow Betty   SPEP   and anticardiolipin antibody sent for further workup of the etiology of her cardiomyopathy . The Courtney   SPEP   and anticardiolipin antibody were all negative . Her CKs did trend down over the course of her hospital stay   and in the setting of her known clean coronaries on cardiac catheterization in 2011-11-19   it was believed that a myocarditis might be the cause of her elevated cardiac enzymes and also could have exacerbated her congestive heart failure . Patient did receive a right heart catheterization   which showed elevated wedge pressures and biopsy specimens were obtained of the right ventricle . The results of these biopsies are still pending in pathology . Post right heart catheterization and right ventricular biopsy   the patient was sent to the CCU for a Swan  guided therapy in the setting of her elevated wedge pressures and low cardiac output . In the CCU   she was put on milrinone with good results . Patient was also seen by the Pulmonary service here and had pulmonary function tests done as part of a pretransplant workup . There is no pulmonary process to exclude her from the transplant list as noted by the Pulmonary service . Patient did receive an ICD during this hospital admission without complication . Patient was in bigeminy during the course of her hospital stay   and did have frequent runs of ectopy as noted on telemetry . 2. Her right lower lobe infiltrate  Patient did report a cough productive of green sputum on admission . She received a full course of azithromycin for this with resolution of her cough and sputum production .

Plain films taken by his orthopedist in Mongcana Ster Staarv revealed some soft tissue calcification within the medial and lateral compartments of the joint . an magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated calcification densities in the suprapatellar bursa region   also with hypertrophia of the synovium . It was felt that the patient had synovial chondromatosis and would benefit from an open synovectomy and debridement . He was admitted for that procedure . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  He had tonsillectomy at the age of five   and appendectomy in 1940 . He had right knee aspirations done in 1986   otherwise   he does not suffer from any other medical problems .,0,
 This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993   while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions   and low dose hydroxyurea . Apparently   a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . He had been noting night sweats   increasing fatigue   anorexia   and dyspnea   which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . He became profoundly thrombocytopenic   and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2  15 with headache and weakness .,0,

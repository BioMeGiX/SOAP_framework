Today, we had the opportunity to see 935 in clinic. As you know she has history of a giant
dissecting type petrous aneurysm. This was found incidentally. She underwent primary enterprise
stenting over 1 year ago. The hope was that the stent would provide some flow remodelling. This
also left the option of stent-assisted coiling. With the advent of the pipeline
stent, we were waiting to see if we can use the more covered stent to occlude
this aneurysm. Currently, the pipeline is available, but this would be
off-label use for this device at this time. Right now, she is doing well; she
has no significant symptoms referable to this aneurysm at this time. She
still is on aspirin to prevent any thromboembolic events. She does have
history of sixth nerve palsy since birth.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Cheryl Lang has a history of giant petrous aneurysm.
Currently, she is doing well. We do recommend MRI/MRA to assess the aneurysm,
the blood vessel, and if there has been any interval thromboembolic events.
We also discussed pipeline stent and at this time, DrXX at yyy
Hospital is the only one that has access to this stent in the Michigan area.
We offered to give a referral to him to discuss the use of this stent in this
case. We also discussed stent-assisted coiling options as well as trapping
and bypass options. At this time, she is not interested in pursuing the stent
coiling or the bypass options. We tend to agree that these do have a much
higher risk of morbidity and mortality.

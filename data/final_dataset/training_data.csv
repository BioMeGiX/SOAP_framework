81, Of note  Na 133   K 4   WBC 8.82   hematocrit 35.1   platelets 229 . PT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3   PTT 25.5 total protein was 6.2   albumin 3.4   globulin of 2.8   calcium of 9.1   phos 2.7   mag 2.1   urea 3.7 . ALT was elevated at 240   AST 85   LDH 305   alk phos 85   total bilirubin was 1.3   direct bili was .8 . Cholesterol 188   triglyceride was 127 . UA  trace protein   trace ketones   positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1 bacteria . Chest x-ray  Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia . In summary   the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA   status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever   four days of diarrhea   nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall . The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea . When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics . So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl   which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her . Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy   which the patient declined . She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done . Another major issue with this patient was pain control . She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion . So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking   so we tried different things for pain management . One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 . After that the patient had minimal relief of pain . However   she declined further blocks   which were offered to her . So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up . She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch . She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours . We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain . Other things that happened during this admission  we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status   which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking . We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions . In addition her liver transaminases were elevated   we thought about doing further work-up   but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that . That has been stable . The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic . Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 . A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH . We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia  we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium  we stopped it . We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction . In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped   so that now at the time of discharge   the patient &aposs sodium is between 126 and 129  prior to that it had gone down to as low 116. So that has really improved . We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day . On the 14th of January   the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &aposs hump . Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE . So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin   we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s. Her INR is 2.3 . We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 . So if it goes much lower than 2   then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night . However   we would leave it at 2.5 for now . Other major issues  As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems   her blood pressure was elevated also . We put her on nifedipine IR   SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic   so we had started her on atenolol . So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 . If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure . The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities   so I think that fluid restriction should help with that . She is also a little dry . The patient is on oxygen . Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen . She was on 4 liters  now she is on 5 liters   sating 94 to 96 on 5 liters . We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well . The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia   pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure . ,1

188, Cardiac arrest  His arrest was of unknown etiology at the time of admission . No further history was ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his hospitalization . CT angiogram had been negative for pulmonary embolism . The patient had an echocardiogram on 2013-04-26   which showed a normal ejection fraction and trivial mitral regurgitation  otherwise no obvious abnormalities were seen . Given the patient had an out of hospital arrest   remained unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability   he was treated with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body temperature to 32 degrees Celsius for a period of twelve hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent six hours . This was done   however   as in problem number two below   we were not successful in any neurologic recovery . Neurology  The patient remained unresponsive after the induced hypothermia   the patient was noticed to develop myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids . Electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing persistent seizure activity . Neurology was consulted and the patient was treated very aggressively   loaded with multiple drugs   including Ativan and Propofol drips . The patient continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this . He was loaded with Dilantin and ultimately was treated with a Pentobarb coma . After multiple attempts of weaning the Pentobarb   the patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was never able to be suppressed . Infectious disease  Over the course of his hospital stay   the patient s white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17 . Multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately found to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia   pneumonia   and urinary tract infection . For all these infections   the patient was treated with Vancomycin and he was also on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission . Blood cultures cleared by 2013-05-03 . Sputum culture as late as 2013-05-10   however was still positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus . The patient remained gravely ill throughout his hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his family with his son being his next of kin . Ultimately it was decided that the patient s wishes would be to not be maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only . With these goals of care   the patient expired on 2013-05-11 . The family did consent to a postmortem examination . DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES  Cardiac arrest .

Colitis . The patient has a history of ischemic bowel status post SMA Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty with recent admission for gram negative rod urosepsis complicated by C. difficile colitis . The patient received a full course of Flagyl and was C. difficile toxin negative times three prior to transfer . He now returns with fever   rising white count   diarrhea   and dehydration . Initially treated with intravenous ceftizoxime   gentamicin   and Flagyl for presumed sepsis   either with urine or bowel source . He was also started on p.o. Vancomycin . Blood cultures and urine cultures came back negative . Stool for C. difficile returned positive . The diagnosis   therefore   was relapsed C. difficile colitis . Intravenous antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was continued on p.o. Vancomycin . He improved clinically with defervescence   decreased white blood cell count to 10 000 with resolution of left shift   and some decrease in abdominal distention on exam . An abdominal CAT scan revealed thickened bowel wall and thumb printing   primarily involving the cecum and right colon greater than the left   consistent with C. difficile colitis . The diagnosis of recurrent bowel ischemia   however   was not ruled out and this will continue to be a concern in the future . The patient was initially n.p.o. and was then advanced to clear liquids which he tolerated . He will be advanced to soft solids prior to discharge . 2. Azotemia . The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.8-2 . Creatinine had risen to 4.3 on admission presumed secondary to sepsis and dehydration . With intravenous hydration the BUN and creatinine fell to 12  1.9 which is within normal limits for this patient . The abdominal CAT scan showed no evidence of hydronephrosis orrenal abscess . 3.

84, On admission   includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing . Hematocrit 39 percent   white blood cell count 4500   PT and PTT normal . Sodium 140   potassium 4.2   chloride 105   carbon dioxide 30   BUN 24   creatinine 1.0 . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory . There   her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44  17 . Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex . She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction . Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch . The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded . The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded . The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis   but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery . This was considered her culprit lesion . This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft . In addition   it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs . Her left internal mammary artery was also unused . It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead . She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing . This was intermittent . The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed . The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker . It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure . Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately . She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time . When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker   she had significant angina . Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable . The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft . He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction . For this reason   it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates . The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service . On August 20   under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm.   which permitted appropriate atrial sensing . There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads . It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode . She tolerated this well . Her medications were resumed . She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase   KS .

151, 1. cerebrovascular accident . The patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery . This was determined by head CT   head MRI   head MRA   carotid noninvasive studies   transcranial Dopplers . The possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor . Her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function   a patent foramen ovale   with a trace right to left shunt   as determined by bubble study   trace MR was present . Previous echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital . Her Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT   but was otherwise unremarkable . The patient had a normal B12   negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization . She was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started . Her exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point   however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day . Her pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge . She needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight   5  22  92 . In addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour . It is discontinued at the time of transport . The patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete . During evaluation of her neurologic status   it was determined that for several months prior to admission   the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate . On our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia   especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown . There are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen . At the time we were to embark on this evaluation   the patient &aposs family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital . What follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia . Her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function   though this is not certain . Moreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions . Our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome   relating to her history of breast Ca . As I mentioned above   her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time . While mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal   the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head . Two possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody . These tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge . The results can be obtained by paging me   Do A. Joasscchird   M.D. at 834-364-2251 . I will be happy to furnish the results . The patient has a history of MI in 1989 . Echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities . EKG   when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q  wave inversion . We would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension   but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this . Persantine thallium is scheduled at this time   but is yet to be performed . The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years . It has been evaluated in the past without success . During her hospitalization   we confirmed the presence of this   even when she was hydrated with saline   to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2 . Studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia . Studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal . This is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk . Florinef is to be considered   however stopping the Isordil is one goal . The patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia . In addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection . This has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray . CT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings . A chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding . A PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday   4 26th . The left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa . The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990   for which she received 6 months of Coumadin . Dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission . It is doubtful that she has chronic PE   but this is one consideration . It is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease   and so this is a consideration . The patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 . We think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic . This can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time . The patient has glaucoma . Her medications are as listed below . Her ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .

176, BY SYSTEM  Respiratory  The baby was intubated in the Delivery Room   received two doses of surfactant . Radiograph revealed bilateral diffuse granular pattern consistent with surfactant deficiency . Maximum mechanical ventilation PIP 26   PEEP 6   rate of 25   maximum FIO2 35 percent . Mychelia was extubated to a CPAP of 6 cm on day of life two where she remained until day of life 20 . On day of life two   she was also loaded with caffeine and continues on caffeine at time of transfer . She was transitioned to a nasal cannula on day of life 20 and remains on nasal cannula O2 100 percent at 13 cc flow . She averaged 2-3 apnea episodes a day with bradycardia and desaturations . She has a comfortable respiratory rate and good air exchange . Cardiovascular  She received a normal saline bolus times one initially for poor perfusion and was started on dopamine with a maximum infusion rate of 6 mcg per kg per hour . This was discontinued on day of life two to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 33 . She has remained hemodynamically stable during the remainder of her hospitalization here . Fluids   electrolytes   nutrition  Initially maintained NPO . UAC and UVC lines were placed upon admission to the CMED . The UAC was left in place until day of life two and was removed after wean from dopamine . UVC remained in place through day of life six and was utilized to administer parenteral nutrition . Electrolytes and glucose remained in the normal range throughout the first week . She was started on enteral feeds on day of life six with a slow advance secondary to increased abdominal girth which was felt to be due to CPAP . She passed meconium . She achieved full feeds on day of life 13 . Calories were gradually increased to breast milk 30 calories with ProMod consisting of four of human milk fortifier   four of MCT and two of Polycose with a 12-28 teaspoon of ProMod per 50 ml of breast milk or 60 ml of formula . On day of life six due to concerns for hyperglycemia and abdominal distention   sepsis evaluation was obtained . She was noted at this time to have hyperglycemia requiring two subcutaneous doses of insulin and a decreased glucose infusion rate to achieve euglycemia . This resolved that same day . Urine output was always noted to be of sufficient quantity . Gastrointestinal  Mychelia demonstrated slow gastrointestinal motility and abdominal distention felt to be due to CPAP . She was slow to advance on enteral feeds and gradually attained full enteral volume on day of life 13 . On day of life 15   she was made NPO for a distended abdomen and a bilious spit . Serial KUBs revealed nonspecific changes with dilated loops . No pneumatosis or free air was seen . She was noted to have bluish discoloration thought to perhaps be a bruise on her left lower quadrant . There was no radiographic correlation with this . Feeds were restarted . Again   she was advanced to full volume but was made NPO on day of life 20 for abdominal distention . This NPO was temporary for that day and she then resumed feedings and has been tolerating full enteral feeds well   improved since off of CPAP   passing normal stools   guaiac negative . Mychelia was also treated for physiologic jaundice . She was started under phototherapy on day of life one through day of life three with a peak serum bilirubin of 4.7  0.3 . This issue resolved . Hematologic and Infectious Disease  Initial CBC was notable for a white count of 5.5 with 49 polys   1 band and 47 lymphs . Initial hematocrit was 46.3 percent and platelets 320 000 . Her initial blood culture remained negative and she received 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamicin . As previously noted on day of life six with hyperglycemia   abdominal distention   a CBC and blood culture were again obtained revealing a white count of 9.1 with 30 polys   0 bands and 58 lymphs . Hematocrit at that time was noted to be 31 and platelets 370 000 . Blood culture grew staph coagulase negative and the baby received seven days of vancomycin and gentamicin . A lumbar puncture was also performed to rule out meningitis . This culture remained negative with normal cell counts and chemistries . Antibiotic levels were monitored and doses adjusted accordingly . Mychelia required two transfusions during her hospital stay . On day of life 15 for a hematocrit of 29   she received 20 cc of packed red blood cells . She started on iron and vitamin E supplements on day of life 25 and continues on that at this time of transfer . However   on day of life 34   12-04   she was noted to be pale and less stress tolerant   mottling easily with care . A hematocrit and reticulocyte count showed a hematocrit of 23 percent and a reticulocyte count of 1.9 percent . Therefore   with blood available from the first aliquot   a second 20 cc per kg of packed red blood cells were infused without incident . Neurological  Initial head ultrasound on day of life seven was normal . At one month of age   on 12-03   she was noted to have an absent septum pellucidum . An MRI obtained and reviewed by the Hallmark Health System Radiology Department revealed focal gyral morphology consistent with prematurity   normal midline structures   normal myelination   no lesions   no signal abnormalities or extracerebral collections . The cortical ribbon is intact . The major vascular structures at the skull base are normal . The septal leaflets may be partially absent   but there are no coronal images provided for confirmation and the pituitary stalk is present . An Ophthalmology consult was obtained to determine the presence of optic nerves . These were both determined to be present and intact . Endocrine was also consulted . Several labs were ordered . Electrolytes and thyroid studies were noted to be in the normal range with serum sodium of 136   potassium 4.7   chloride 98 and CO2 34 . She had a calcium of 10.3   a phosphorus of 4.8 and alkaline phosphatase of 440 . Thyroid function studies revealed a TSH of 2.2   T4 of 5.7   T3 of 101 and a cortisol level of 43   all within the normal range . A growth hormone was sent and the results were pending at time of transfer . In addition   an FSH and LH were obtained on 12-10 and results are pending at time of transfer . Please contact lab control at Mattapan Community Health Center for results   409  238-8236 . The baby s neurologic examination is appropriate for corrected gestational age which is 33 and 6  7 weeks on day of transfer .

175, BY SYSTEM  1. NEUROLOGY  Mr. Roach was transported to Intensive Care Unit from the trauma bay . Upon arrival   Neurosurgery promptly placed V. Holtzen bolt . This allowed continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure . Notably   intracranial pressure was 17 when the bolt was placed . During his hospitalization   his intracranial pressure was monitored very closely and maintained to a level of less than 20 . To do this   mannitol 25 mg q. 6h. was used . While using mannitol   his serum osmolalities were followed closely . In addition   to monitoring his intracranial pressure   his systemic blood pressures were maintained in such a manner that his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg . A parameter monitor for his neurologic status PaCO2 which was maintained between 35 and 40 during his hospitalization . Mr. Roach was kept sedated with propofol and was given Fentanyl and    or morphine boluses for pain . Neurologic checks were followed initially every one hour and then every two hours to monitor for change in neurologic examination . During his hospitalization   two subsequent CAT scans were obtained  one on hospital day two . This CAT scan revealed possible worsening and was read as epidural versus subdural bleed . After a discussion with both Radiology and Neurosurgery   the decision was made that the worsening did not appear significant   and this was not accompanied by a change in his clinical condition . His intracranial pressure remained stable   and his clinical examination was unchanged . An additional CT scan was obtained on hospital day three . This examination was unchanged from the previous examination . Again   his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same   and conservative treatment was opted for . CARDIOVASCULAR  As described in previous section   Neo-Synephrine and eventually Levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than 70 . A pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four . This catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support . Please see Infectious Disease section for more details . 3. GASTROINTESTINAL  Mr. Roach was n.p.o. from the time of his admission . A orogastric tube was passed . Initially during admission   carafate was given down the orogastric tube . However   on a routine chest x-ray shot on hospital day three   a mediastinum was noted . This raised the question of potential esophageal rupture . Gastroenterology was consulted for this . Gastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status . At this point   his carafate was switched to intravenous Protonix and he was strictly n.p.o. 4. HEMATOLOGY  Throughout Mr. Richard admission   his hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s . As will be discussed in the Infectious Disease section   he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis   and his white blood cell count peaked at 23 . Mr. Roach was on Pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis . He was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage . An inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred   as it was felt that Mr. Roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure . 5. ENDOCRINE  Mr. Marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from 100 to 130 using a regular insulin sliding-scale . 6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE  Mr. Roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers . His blood urine and sputum were all cultured . Blood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram  positive coagulase  negative Staphylococcus which grew from 08-25 . His preliminary cultures including sputum from 08-25 grew Escherichia coli . Sputum from 08-27 grew gram-negative rods   not yet speciated   and from 08-27 a bronchoalveolar lavage grew 1 gram-negative rods and 4 polymorphonuclear lymphocytes . Throughout this time   Mr. Richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four   his temperature maximum was 42.2 degrees centigrade . During his hospitalization   his was treated with vancomycin for his gram-negative rods   imipenem   and Flagyl . Initially   he had been placed on clindamycin to cover his drain   but his cultures became positive   and his white blood cell count increased . He was switched from clindamycin to the imipenem and Flagyl . Vancomycin was added when we had the positive blood culture . With a fever of 102   up to 42 degrees centigrade   aggressive measures including cooling blankets   alcohol swabs   and fans were used in an attempt to bring his body temperature down . Hypercarbia would result and increase in cerebral perfusion   paralysis was initiated to decrease genesis of carbon dioxide secreted during shivering . 7. PULMONARY  As discussed in the Infectious Disease section   Mr. Roach developed a pneumonia likely from gram-negative organisms   but most likely from Escherichia coli . For this pneumonia   he was placed empirically on imipenem   vancomycin   and Flagyl . On hospital day three   Mr. Roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea . For this   a CT angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism . On hospital day four   a routine chest x-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax . For this   a left 34 Caucasian chest tube was placed . On the evening of hospital day four   Mr. Roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole . Urgent resuscitation measures were initiated . The measures included attempts at pacing . Epinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium . He had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax   cardiac tamponade   and pulmonary embolism . During the resuscitation afterwards   it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest   so initially neo-decompression was attempted in the right chest . There was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression   and a right chest tube was placed . During this time   a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back . A left anterior thoracotomy was made by the Cardiac Surgery fellow who was present . After 30 minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage   there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors . Resuscitation was terminated at 1914 on 08-27 . After the termination of resuscitation   both the anesthesia Intensive Care Unit attending and the surgical attending were present to discuss the proceedings events with the patient s family members including his next of kin   his mother . Permission for a postmortem examination was granted . Matthew M. Barnett   M.D. 78 -102 Dictated By  Mark D.

155, A Neurosurgery consultation was obtained   and it was their impression that the patient &aposs paraplegia might possibly represent a cord concussion   and recommended treatment with intravenous steroids for 24 hours . The patient &aposs paraplegia resolved by the morning of her second hospital day   and she maintained 5  5 motor strength in all groups . A Urology consultation was obtained   and it was recommended that an IVP be obtained . This was obtained on the day of discharge   however   due to residual contrast in the colon from the patient &aposs prior abdominal CT scan the exam was postponed after a scout film was obtained . The patient fell well on the day of discharge . She remained afebrile throughout her hospital course .

177, BY SYSTEM 1. PULMONARY  She was treated with albuterol and Atrovent continuous nebulizers and was weaned then to intermittent nebulizer treatments and then to her meter-dosed inhalers taking them q.4h. at the time of discharge . She was continued on salmeterol and Flovent . She was continued on Solu-Medrol 80 mg q.8h. then converted to prednisone at 60 mg p.o. q.d. She was started on Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d. Serial arterial blood gases were followed after an arterial line was placed . Her PCO2 gradually declined to the 48 range . Despite episodes of somnolence the first night which were presumably due to having spent the entire night in the Emergency Department   she never became more hypercarbic   and her PCO2 trended to 48 by the time the arterial line was discontinued . On the night of admission and thereafter   she was noted to have a very stridorous sounding breathing when the patient was asleep . This would disappear whenever she was awake . Her case was discussed with Ear  Nose  Throat and the Medical Intensive Care Unit attending . She was given a trial of 80  20 mixed helium  oxygen to decrease the stridor but had minimal effect . Ear  Nose  Throat recommended not considering this an airway problem unless she was stridorous while awake . The patient was to arrange for Pulmonary and Medicine followup through her primary care physician upon discharge as she has not been seen in the Pulmonary Clinic in two years . 2. CARDIOVASCULAR  The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial creatine kinases   although these did rise to 816 . MB was negative . She was treated with captopril for hypertension   and this was switched to Norvasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. on discharge . She had an echocardiogram which showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular of normal thickness and size   and no significant valvular disease . She apparently did not have a cardiovascular component to her wheezing or shortness of breath  however   she was to go home on Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. to help with lower extremity edema   as she experiences discomfort with this   and the team felt this may be a limiting factor with her prednisone compliance . 3. ENDOCRINE  She was treated with a sliding-scale of regular insulin while she was in house . She was given 500 mg p.o. q.d. of metformin to treat her steroid-induced diabetes on discharge . This should be followed up by her primary care physician . 4. INFECTIOUS DISEASE  She was treated briefly with levofloxacin because of the gram-positive cocci in her sputum culture  however   her symptoms were felt to be consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection   and levofloxacin was continued at the time of discharge .

After discussion   it was decided to attempt to obtain 28 weeks gestation and then deliver electively by cesarean section given the decompensation in the third trimester . The patient underwent primary low transverse cesarean section on 2014-05-19 at approximately 28 weeks gestation . The cesarean section was performed on the West Campus in the Cardiothoracic Surgical Suite . This was performed in this location in case any acute cardiac decompensation occurred during the time of cesarean section . Cardiothoracic Surgery was on standby during the surgery . The patient went to the cardiac Intensive Care Unit on the West Campus postoperatively . She did well during the postoperative period . She required several episodes of diuresis due to increasing shortness of breath on postoperative day 1 and postoperative day 2 due to worsening symptoms of shortness of breath from fluid shifts that normally occur during the postpartum period . The patient was transferred to the West Campus on postoperative day 2 in stable condition . She did well during the remainder of her postoperative course and was continued on her medication regimen that she had been on during the antepartum period . She was discharged to home on postoperative day 4 . She was to followup with Maternal Fetal Medicine in 5 to 7 days . She had followup with her primary cardiologist in Shaugnessy-Kaplan Rehab Hospital scheduled for 1 week postoperatively . Of note   the patient also underwent tubal ligation at the time of cesarean section .,0

She is referred for progressive angina . She had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing . She has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 . In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded . In October   1989   Dr. No re-did her bypass operation . She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending   saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 . In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block . She had exertional angina at that time . In November   1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis   high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft . She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis . Since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning   radiating to the left neck and arm   relieved by nitroglycerin . She was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . Because these symptoms have been increasing   particularly at cardiac rehabilitation   she was referred here . In May   1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic . She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect . She has had no syncope . Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol . She has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother   sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction . She is a remote cigarette smoker . She also has a history of lactose intolerance   peptic ulcer disease   with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages . She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .,0

Humulin Walters insulin 24 units subcutaneous q A.M. and 8 to 16 in the evening depending upon where his blood sugar has been . Preoperative laboratory values were unremarkable . The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 2011-10-17 which revealed a 20 left vein osteal lesion as well as 70 LAD lesion and an 80 right coronary . The patient was taken to the operating room on 2011-10-18 where he underwent an aortic valve replacement with 23 mm pericardial valve as well as coronary artery bypass graft times two with a LIMA to the LAD and saphenous vein to the acute marginal . Postoperatively the patient was transported to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on Milrinone   Neo-Synephrine and Levophed drip . The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and subsequently extubated on the night of surgery . He remained on Levophed   Milrinone and Neo-Synephrine drips and was hemodynamically stable . N. Saez clinic consult was obtained due to hyperglycemia and the need for insulin drip in the Intensive Care Unit . On postoperative day the Milrinone was weaned down . The Levophed had been discontinued as the Neo-Synephrine and the patient was beginning to progress hemodynamically . Upon discontinuation of the Milrinone the patient s SV02 had dropped significantly in the low 50 s. The patient had decreased exercise tolerance and therefore was placed back on his milrinone to keep his cardiac index greater than 2.0 . Over the next couple of days it was very slowly decreased as his Ace inhibitors were increased orally . The patient ultimately was weaned off the Milrinone   transitioned to Captopril on postoperative day five and remained hemodynamically stable . Once the patient had remained off of inotropics for approximately 24 hours   he had been given diuretics and Ace inhibitors and remained hemodynamically stable he was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the Telemetry floor on postoperative day six . A physical therapy evaluation was obtained for assistance and mobility . Cardiac rehabilitation was initiated at that time . On 2011-10-24 postoperative day six consultation heart failure cardiology service was obtained . It was their recommendation to continue Ace inhibitors   to continue daily weights   to switch the patient to a long acting beta-blocker and to enroll the patient in postoperative cardiac rehabilitation as well as to make sure the patient was on statin drugs . These measures were all instituted . The patient continued to progress from cardiac rehabilitation and physical therapy standpoint while on the floor . The patient remained hemodynamically stable over the next few days   continued to increase with physical therapy and ambulation . His blood sugars were followed by the Cape Cod Hospital Clinic service and insulin has been adjusted accordingly . Today   2011-10-31   postoperative day 13 the patient remains stable and ready for discharge to home . The patient s condition today is as follows  Temperature 96.9 F   pulse 84   respiratory rate 18   blood pressure 106  59 .

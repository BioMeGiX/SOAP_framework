154, 1  Cardiovascular  The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction . She remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time . The patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities . The patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix . The patient &aposs Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm . The patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia . At this time   the patient &aposs presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology . 2  Neurological    vascular  The discrepancy in the patient &aposs pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis . The patient underwent MRI    MRA of the head   neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis   proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery . The left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon . The patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA . MRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct . The patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease . The patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally . The results of these studies suggested that the patient &aposs symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon   and therefore   it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and    or surgical or percutaneous intervention . A Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient &aposs intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure . 3  Orthopedic The patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event . Outside hip films were obtained   but were not available for view . Repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture   likely new . An Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance . A bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative . At the time of this dictation   the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of Physical Therapy and a walker .Plan,0

He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin C .', 'His Coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding   even though it was important to keep his INR 2.5-3.5   given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to', 'great to continue the Coumadin . He was subsequently seen by the GI team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following', 'In the esophagus   there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum   the mucous appeared edematous .', 'A small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding  an Endoclip was applied to this . Another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there .', 'In the duodenum   a small AVM was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized . The biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation', 'and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia . Also of note   prior to the upper endoscopy   the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation .', 'Patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge .', 'His last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3 . His last BUN and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an INR of 2.5 .

153, 1  Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia  The video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . The patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay . This was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems   see below . By discharge   she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper . The patient &aposs bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course   however on July 12   1998   after starting dialysis  see below    the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen . Repeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually   the patient &aposs pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks . At the time of her discharge   the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90 . 2  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  The patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28   hematocrit of 32   LDH of 496 with 2 schistocytes and 2 spherocytes on her smear . This was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20   1998   she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27   1999 . She was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge . Her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3   1998   then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20   1999 . Her LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s   but remained elevated . She continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear   but it was much decreased . The patient also required red blood cell transfusions   approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit . Eventually   her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27   1999 . After this   the patient &aposs platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge . It is felt that the patient &aposs thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved . She will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper . 3  Renal  The patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 . Throughout the month of June   she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12   1998 . The opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week . She required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload . During the course of her dialysis   she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation . 4  Infectious disease The patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23   1998   July 4   1998   July 8   1998 and July 9   1998 . The patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10   1998 which remained patent and uninfected . She received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime . In addition   she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation   which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days . She also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21   1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus . She was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days . The patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids . 5  Rheumatology  The patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative . Unfortunately throughout her admission   we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange . A repeat ANA   rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient . FOLLOW-UP  1  The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician   Dr. Tamarg Study   in Arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation . 2  The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on Monday   Wednesday and Friday . The nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. Study . 3  The patient will continue to have her CBC   LDH   bilirubin   chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm   the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 . 4  The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula . The left subclavian Tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time . She would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this . 5  The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 . 6  The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month  this was started on July 27   1999  and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary . 7  The patient has a follow-up appointment in the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Cedwi Stone at 336-2931 on August 30   1999 at 140 PM . 8  The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm at the We Erthunt Hospital at 180-0455 on August 15   1999 at 1230 PM .

GNR sepsis Upon admission   pt was febrile to 101.2 with U  A consistent with UTI . A CT abd showed 8mm obstructing stone   hydro with stranding consistent with pylonephritis . Her presentation was thought likely due to urosepsis given h  o foul smelling urine and in setting of stone w   hydro  pyelo by CT. The patient went to IR on 2014-11-30 given evidence of right hydronephrosis on imaging for decompression and drainage. Upon admission   she was treated with Vancomycin and Gentamycin and Flagyl . She was started on the MUST protocol with high dose steroids as well and a goal SVO2 >70 . She was hypoxic requiring 3L nasal cannula O2 . She subsequently developed hypotension with SBP in the 70s . She was transferred to the CMED where the patient was continued on the MUST protocol with goais of CVP 10-12   SVO2 greater than 70 . The patient was bolused with NS and did not required pressors . On the day after admission to the CMED   the patient was noted to have small oxygen requirement with 2L NC . Repeat imaging revealed evidence of mild pulmonary congestion which was thought to account for the patient s mild hypoxia . Given that the patient had been maintaining a MAP of 60 without fluids or pressors   her goal CVP was decreased to >8 to avoid fluid overload . The patient was continued on Vancomycin and Gentamycin while speciation and sensitivities were pending . Ciprofloxacin was added on 2014-12-01 for synergy when surveillance cultures were found to be growing again GNR . Gent and Cipro were then discontinued and changed to meropenem when blood culture sensitivities became available revealing GNR sensitive to Jacoby but resistant to both Gent and Cipro . Additionaly surveillance cultures were drawn daily and the patient was transferred back to the floor with no subsequent pressor requirement . Blood cltures from 11-30 grew KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE and 12-01 grew KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE and PROTEUS MIRABILIS both sensitive to the Meropenam which she had already been receiving . Urine cultures from 11-30 grew STAPH AUREUS COAG    and GRAM NEGATIVE RODS of two morphologies  not further speciated  . She defervesed by 12-02 and remained clinically stable with normal blood pressures until the day of discharge . At the time of discharge   blood cultures from 12-02 and 12-03 have no growth to date . She received a midline on 12-04 with a goal of 16 days of further antibiotic treatment with Meropenam  for a total of 3 weeks  upon discharge back to the nursing home where she lives . .  Right hydronephrosis  Given right sided hydronephrosis and GNR bactermeia   a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed by IR 2014-11-30 . The patient put out 1385 cc urine the day after placement   950 cc of which came from nephrostomy tube . The tube appeared to be functioning well   draining urine with occasional clot passage . Urology was notified about the clots and occasional blood tinged urine but they did not make any further recommendations . Cultures from urine drawn from the nephrostomy tube are currently growing > 100K GNR   possibly of two colony morphologies   speciation and sensitivity pending . .  Hct drop  On admission to hospital patient had Hct of 29.2 . In the setting of Right sublavian line placement as well as nephrostomy tube placement the patient was noted to have a drifting Hct   concerning for bleed   with nadir of 22.8 on 2014-12-01 . A CT abdomen was performed which did not demonstrate any retroperitoneal bleed . Hct stabilized to 24 for three days prior to discharge . This can be followed as an outpatient .

Hypoxia The patient on admission was requiring 3 L NC in the setting of receiving 2L NS and chest film which demonstrated pulmonary congestion . The patient was not diuresed but allowed to auto-diurese any additional fluids and is currently with O2 sats 97-98 on room air . As her BP remained stable she did not receiving any standing fluids but was be bolused as appropriate for a MAP   60 or CVP   8 with careful monitoring of pulmonary status . Patient had an echocardiogram in 2012 which demonstrated an EF of 60-65 . her O2 requirement by discharge was 96 on room air with no SOB . .  Steroid-induced hyperglycemia  At home   the patient received metformin and SSI . The patient s metformin was held and she has been maintained on SSI qid while in the CMED . As the patient appeared to be clinically stable   her stress dose steroids were discontinued and the patient was changed back to her home dose of Prednisone 40mg PO qd for maintenance with anticipated decrease in her blood sugars . Her Metformin was re-added 2 days prior to discharge as well and fingerstick glucoses on the day of discharge were 93 and 156   respectively . .  Hypothyroidism  Repeat TSH and Free T4 were appropriate on current outpatient regimen. Patient was continued on Levothyroxine 75mcg po qd . .

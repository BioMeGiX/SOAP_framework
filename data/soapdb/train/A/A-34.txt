ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. Right hip pain, strongly suggestive of osteoarthritis of the hip, and  possible lumbosacral spine.  We will check x-rays of the hip and lumbosacral  spine.  Glucosamine recommended, tramadol to be tried very cautiously, be  aware of the side effects.  All of these discussed.  Referred to Physical  Therapy.  Follow up in 2-4 weeks, to evaluate the evolution while on physical  therapy.  I am considering referral to Orthopedics if pain persist.  
2. Hypertension.  Blood pressure at goal now.  Chem-7 normal.  
3. Impaired glucose tolerance.  Hemoglobin A1c improved now, 5.8.  Continue  with the same diet and exercise.
4. Dyslipidemia.  Continue statin therapy.
5. Smoking cessation once discussed.  She had side effects from Chantix.  She  states she is doing very well decreasing the number of cigarettes that she  smokes, and almost ready to quit.  Encouraged.  
Follow up in 1 month.

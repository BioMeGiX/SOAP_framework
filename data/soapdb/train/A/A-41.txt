ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
1. Hypertension.  Blood pressure checked couple of times in the  office today, was at goal.  I will check CHEM-7.  Check blood  pressure routinely, keep a log, goal below 130/80.  
2. Intermittent eye pain.  Referral to Ophthalmology and emergent  referral to Neurosurgery was also given.  
3. Her tension headache today actually resolved with Tylenol 650  mg.  By the time she left, she was actually headache free, but  this eye discomfort that she has described as occurring  intermittently, needs to be reevaluated, therefore she will  follow up with Ophthalmology, Neurosurgery, and also I referred  the patient to Neurology.  
4. Impaired glucose tolerance.  I will check hemoglobin A1c.  
5. Dyslipidemia.  Liver function test, fasting lipid profile will  be checked.  
. Follow up in 1 week or sooner if any problems occur.  If  intense headache, go to ER.

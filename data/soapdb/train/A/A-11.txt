ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
 
XXX is a  74 y.o. female with history of incidental aneurysmal dilatation at the Acom jxn.  She is asymptomatic from the aneurysm.  The aneurysm has poor geometry for coiling or even selective clip reconstruction.  I recommend continued conservative treatment with BP control, smoking avoidance, and repeat studies in 6 months.

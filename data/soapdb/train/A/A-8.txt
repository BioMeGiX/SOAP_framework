ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
Cheryl Lang has a history of giant petrous aneurysm.
Currently, she is doing well. We do recommend MRI/MRA to assess the aneurysm,
the blood vessel, and if there has been any interval thromboembolic events.
We also discussed pipeline stent and at this time, DrXX at yyy
Hospital is the only one that has access to this stent in the Michigan area.
We offered to give a referral to him to discuss the use of this stent in this
case. We also discussed stent-assisted coiling options as well as trapping
and bypass options. At this time, she is not interested in pursuing the stent
coiling or the bypass options. We tend to agree that these do have a much
higher risk of morbidity and mortality.

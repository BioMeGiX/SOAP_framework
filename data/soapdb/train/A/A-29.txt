ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. Right hip pain, due to osteoarthritis.  She would benefit from physical therapy, but she declines it, she already went through it.  We will refer to orthopedist.
2. Left lower extremity pain, which seems positional, with compression of the nerve, resembling meralgia paresthetica on the left.  She will discuss this aspect with orthopedist also.  She would benefit from physical therapy, gentle massage, adjustment of the positions, etc.
3. Rectal bleeding.  She is known to have internal hemorrhoids, but she has had bleeding recently, she tells me quite often, and appears to be large, the toilet seems to have large amount of blood.  We will check CBC.  We will check also coags.  Emergent referral to Colorectal Surgery was given.
4. Ecchymosis.  Non-observed today.  We will check CBC, anemia studies, and PT, PTT, INR, and platelets count.  She should follow up in the office in 1-2 weeks given the multitude of problems addressed.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
This is a 49-year-old woman with history of right petrous
carotid canal aneurysm. We do recommend an angiogram to further define this
lesion. It is in a relatively unusual location, but has a low risk of
future bleeding. It is also below the cavernous sinus and so compression of
cranial nerves are unlikely. She could have thromboembolic events from this
aneurysm. A baby aspirin may be helpful to prevent future thromboembolic
events. This aneurysm is probably unrelated though to her recent symptoms.
An angiogram may be helpful to rule out remote possibility of a dissection
causing left-sided face pain. We will also refer her to neuroophthalmology
to evaluate her chronic bilateral sixth nerve palsies. After the angiogram,
we can determine whether future treatment is warranted or possible.

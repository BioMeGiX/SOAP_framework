ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Rectal bleeding. FOB test ws positive. Previous colonoscopy showed internal hemorrhoids.  I will refer the patient to colorectal surgeon.
 
2.  Fatigue.  We will expand our investigations to include repeat blood count, iron studies, TSH, folic acid, B12, etc.
 
3.  Urinary urgency.  She doesn't have any symptoms of urinary tract infection, but I wanted to rule that out.  Though, she has hematuria and I am quite concerned about this.  Urine culture is pending.  I will check renal ultrasound, and we'll discuss the results of the test with next visit.
 
4.  Impaired glucose tolerance.  Hemoglobin A1c at 6.4, this is very close to diabetes.  We discussed this aspect, lifestyle changes.  We'll continue to monitor.
 
5.  Hypertension.  Blood pressure is at goal.
 
The visit today was very lengthy, time spent with patient more than 40 minutes today, half of the time coordinating care and addressing multiple problems.  Follow up in 10 to 14 days.

Assessment and Plan:
 
is a  45 y.o. male with history of basilar aneurysm anterior communicating aneurysm and MCA aneurysm.  I recommend angiogram for intent for coiling of basilar and possible anterior
communicating artery aneurysms
……………
As you know he is a 45 y.o. male who presents with incidental basilar apex aneurysm.  This was found as part of a work up for possible renal cell carcinoma and polycythemia.  
He had RBC in his urine.  He denies neurologic deficits.  He denies stroke, seizure or headaches.


Assessment and Plan:
 
XXX is a  45 y.o. male with history of new renal mass and polycythemia.  A screening study for brain lesions was performed and demonstrated an incidental aneurysm.  His aneurysm is about 5-6 mm and is located at the basilar bifurcation.  The risk of aneursymal hemorrhage is about 1% per year.  Because of his age treatment would be favored.  An endovascular approach would be less morbid in this location.  We will order a formal MRI MRA of brain to assess the geometry of the aneurysm as well as assess the brain for tumors more precisely.  We will then call him about more detailed treatment options.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
X is a 38-year-old woman with history of headaches who recently had two unusual headaches. She underwent imaging that
demonstrated no evidence of bleeding. This did demonstrate though an
incidental intracranial aneurysm. This aneurysm is about 5 mm in size. This
aneurysm does have a risk of future bleeding. On a day-to-day, year-to-year
basis, the risk is not overly high. We feel an aneurysm in this location of
this size has less than 1% chance of bleeding per year. However, she
is young and over her lifetime this can add up. We do feel that treatment
consideration is indicated. We discussed the different treatment options. We
feel the conservative option is not ideal because of her age and future risk
of hemorrhage. Different interventional or surgical approaches were
discussed. We feel an endovascular coiling would be the least invasive at
this time. We did have concerns about the geometry of the aneurysm. We
discussed the risk of technical failure, stoke, and bleeding. She stated
understanding, and would like to pursue endovascular treatment of this
intracranial aneurysm.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
 
XXX is a 51 y.o. female with history of fibromuscular dysplasia FMD, previous ischemic right lateral medullary stroke , plus SAH secondary to a dissecting type left vertebral artery 
aneurysm s/p coiling in 2010 and then the de novo formation of a R PICA distal dissecting aneurysm in December of 2012.  She underwent R PICA aneurysm coil occlusion.
This exacerbated her previous lateral medullary stroke.  She continues to have facial asymmetry from stroke, mild swallowing difficulties and ataxia.
She is interested in plastic surgery and a gold weight in the eyelid to help with the facial palsy.  From a neurosurgical standpoint that is ok.  
She needs tight BP control.  If she has continued diastolic hypertension consideration should be made to evaluate her renal arteries considering her FMD changes in the brain.  
Follow up MRA of the brain is indicated in November or 2013.

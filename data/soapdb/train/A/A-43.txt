ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
X is status post treatment of an incidental
aneurysm. She does have two very small incidental aneurysms that are
unsecured. We do recommend an MRI of the brain as well as MRA post coil
protocol to monitor her treated right carotid terminus aneurysm and check her
very small right posterior communicating artery lesion and left carotid
ophthalmic artery aneurysm.

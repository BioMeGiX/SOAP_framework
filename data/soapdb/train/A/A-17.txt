 
Assessment and Plan:
 
X is a  86 y.o. female with history of multiple medical problems who was referred for an incidental 6 mm posterior communicating artery aneurysm.  
We feel this aneurysm has about a 1 % risk of bleeding per year.  Preventive treatment would be beneficial if she has a projected 5 year survival.   
Endovascular treatment could be performed with a < 5% major complication rate.  The family will contact the office if they wish to pursue treatment, 
but at this time they are leaning toward conservative management.

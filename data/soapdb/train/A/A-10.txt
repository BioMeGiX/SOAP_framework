Assessment/Plan:
 
XXX is a 73 y.o. male with a diagnosis of newly diagnosed vertebrobasilar junction fusiform aneurysm which is enlarging.  
I recommend observation and following up with Dr. Greg Thompson at University of Michigan to see if he would be a candidate for a pipeline stent.  
We also recommend an appointment with a neuropsychologist to address the wife's concern about his forgetfulness. 
These recommendations were discussed with the patient.  A total of 40 minutes was spent with the patient, including 30 minutes of counseling.

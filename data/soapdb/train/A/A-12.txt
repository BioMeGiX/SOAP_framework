ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
XXXXXXXXX is a 53-year-old woman with history of
multiple sclerosis, Chiari malformation, and incidental aneurysms. From the
incidental aneurysm standpoint, we recommend a follow up MRA in one year. Her
very small untreated aneurysms have not changed in size and her treated
aneurysms demonstrate very small neck remnants that do not require any
significant treatment at this time. We will have to continue to follow these,
and if they demonstrate significant recanalization, then it would be
worthwhile to do an angiogram for possible recoiling. These findings on MRA
are unrelated to her current complaints. In terms of the Chiari malformation,
I see no hydrocephalus. There seems to be good CSF space at the
foramen magnum. I don't recommend any sort of surgical intervention. In terms
of the cervical syrinx, this has not increased in size, and in fact looks
smaller than what it did before her surgery. I do not recommend any sort of
procedure to shunt this very small cervical syrinx.

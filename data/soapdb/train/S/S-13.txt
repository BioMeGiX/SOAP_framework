HISTORY: 
90-year-old woman, with severe COPD, cigarette use until xxx, dilated cardiomyopathy, combined systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure, cardiac pacemaker, hypertension, recurrent dizziness/vertigo, hospitalization January, 2018 with GI bleed/colitis, and other problems summarized below.  Last visit March, 2018.  Return sooner than scheduled concerned about ear wax.
 
She has chronic hearing loss.  She wears hearing aids.  Apparently went to see her hearing aid clinic, and was advised that she had ear wax in her right ear.  She try to get this out at home but has been unsuccessful.  She complains of decreased hearing and plugged feeling in the right ear.  No pain or drainage.
 
Has no other acute complaints.  Reports that otherwise she has been stable.  She plans to be seen here next month for follow-up of her chronic medical problems
 
 
 
 
    
  
Smoking:Quit smoking 2/xx15
  
Alcohol: None 
  
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
* Hypertension, for more than 15 years.  
* Dilated cardiomyopathy. Echocardiogram has revealed decreased systolic function for several  
years. Initially there was some concern about previous silent infarct, based on EKG evidence of  
inferior scar. Echocardiogram in xxxx showed ejection fraction 40%. Nuclear stress test in XXXX  
showed ejection fraction 40%, global hypokinesis, large inferior/inferolateral defect which was  
fixed (possible inferior infarct), severe hypokinesis of inferior wall. Cardiac catheterization in  
XXX showed essentially normal coronary arteries with ejection fraction 20%. Echocardiogram /xx10  
showed ejection fraction 30-35% . Echocardiogram xxx shows ejection fraction 37%.  
*Hospitalization xxx, acute on chronic congestive heart failure; BNP elevated, CTA chest showed cardiomegaly, right greater than left pleural effusions, atelectasis, suspicion of congestive heart failure with groundglass airspace disease in right upper lobe. Treated with diuresis, oxygen
*Cardiac pacemaker placed xxx, near syncope, systolic dysfunction, arrhythmia, PVCs, PACs, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia--Pacemaker placed by Dr. XXX
*Hospitalization XXX, congestive heart failure, resolved with diuresis; Echocardiogram showed ejection fraction 25%, grade 1 diastolic dysfunction, Mitral regurgitation
*Hospitalization XXX, dizziness, exacerbation of COPD, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia
*Hospitalization 9/2017, exacerbation of heart failure; resolved with diuresis; Chest x-ray pulmonary vascular congestion, BNP 1600
*Hospitalization 1/2018, colitis, sepsis, hematemesis/melena; presented with nausea vomiting hematemesis; a CT abdomen showed inflammatory changes of distal transverse and descending colon consistent with colitis; improved with antibiotic Cipro/metronidazole.  Developed possible visual hallucinations, discontinue Cipro, substitute Bactrim DS, continue metronidazole =
*Chronic cigarette use, with occasional wheezing. Pulmonary function test in XXX showed only  
minimal obstructive change --Quit smoking completely XXX
*Mild COPD
*Dizziness. Chronic.CT head negative, MRI brain  
6/2010 showed some motion artifact, and mild ischemic change. A followup MRI scan done at Henry  
Ford Macomb Hospital XXX showed a small aneurysm, 3 mm. No treatment was necessary but she was  
told that she needed to followup . Increased dizziness XXX, treated with meclizine. CT head, carotid duplex, MRI angiogram brain, were all performed in xxxx.
* Dr. XXX of neurosurgery for consultation xxx. No treatment was recommended. Followup CT  
angiogram in 6 months recommended. Patient has been asymptomatic. CT angiogram xxxx showed  
multiple intracranial aneurysms, largest 7 mm; neurosurgeon Dr. XXX advises observation; CT angiogram
zzzzz, showed multiple intracranial aneurysms stable from previous examination, some narrowing of the right vertebral artery; neurosurgeon advise his observation CT-Angiogram of head and neck sssss, showed multiple intracranial arterial aneurys, No change  
*MR angiogram brain without contrast xxx, hypoplastic P1 segment left ACA, 4 mm saccular aneurysm at bifurcation of the A1 segment of the right ECA\
*CT head without contrast xxx, age-related volume loss, chronic white matter changes, no acute abnormality
*CT head 7xxxx, no acute abnormality, fluid in the left mastoid cells and middle ear; maxillary sinus disease
* Lumbar spondylosis, previous lumbar radiculopathy. X-ray in 2007 show some degenerative lumbar  
changes.  
*Glaucoma  
*Subretinal hemorrhage of left eye evaluated by ophthalmologist last year  
*Past history stress/urge incontinence, she wears a pad; previously used Detrol  
* Psoriasis  
*Possible rheumatic fever; the old record indicates history of rheumatic fever, but the patient  
cannot really remember the details. His history is not confirmed  
*Previous Simvastatin use. Her cholesterol has been normal. This apparently was started because of  
cardiac disease. She quit taking simvastatin xxxx because of muscle pain.  
* Bone density xxx, osteopenia  
*Mammogram6 last 2015, normal
* EKG yyyy, abnormal, sinus rhythm, poor R-wave progression, nonspecific ST-T wave  
abnormalities, possible old inferior infarct; EKG 10/2011, sinus bradycardia, interventricular  
conduction delay. ;  
*EKG yyy, left bundle branch block, sinus rhythm

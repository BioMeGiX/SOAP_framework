INTERVAL HISTORY: 
Today, we had the opportunity to see 935 in clinic. As you know she has history of a giant
dissecting type petrous aneurysm. This was found incidentally. She underwent primary enterprise
stenting over 1 year ago. The hope was that the stent would provide some flow remodelling. This
also left the option of stent-assisted coiling. With the advent of the pipeline
stent, we were waiting to see if we can use the more covered stent to occlude
this aneurysm. Currently, the pipeline is available, but this would be
off-label use for this device at this time. Right now, she is doing well; she
has no significant symptoms referable to this aneurysm at this time. She
still is on aspirin to prevent any thromboembolic events. She does have
history of sixth nerve palsy since birth.

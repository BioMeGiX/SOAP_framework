HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :

Today, we had the opportunity to see X in neurosurgery clinic.
As you know, she was referred for evaluation of an intracranial aneurysm.
This aneurysm was found after she underwent a CT scan of her orbit. The CT
scan of the orbit was performed because she was having headaches behind her
left eye. Approximately six weeks ago, she had a severe headache lasting six
hours. She stated the headache was focused behind her left eye and near the
orbit. She had some nausea and vomiting. This headache then dissipated. She
did well for a period of time, but she has had some mild headaches for the
last six weeks. Again, last Saturday, she had a similar headache involving
her left eye behind the orbit. She denies any double vision or any visual
changes. She denies any changes in her sleep patterns. She denies any
changes in her diet or consumption of caffeine. She is a nonsmoker. She does
have a history of migraine headache since childhood, but as of late they have
not been too frequent. She stated that when she has migraines, the headaches can be severe
associated with nausea and vomiting. After her CT of the orbit, she
was found to have a 5-mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm. This is
predominantly fed from the right A1. The left A1 is hypoplastic with some contribution. The
neck of the aneurysm is relatively wide. A very small carotid cavernous
dilatation was also appreciated about 2 mm in size.

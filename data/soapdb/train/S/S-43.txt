HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Dear Dr. Vidinas:
Today, we had the opportunity to see X in neurosurgery clinic. As
you know, she is a 62-year-old woman, who underwent endovascular coiling of a
right carotid terminus aneurysm on 10/07/2011. This was for an incidental
aneurysm. She was also found to have a very small left carotid ophthalmic
artery aneurysm as well as a possible right posterior communicating artery
1.5-mm dilatation. Recently, X had what she describes as pulling
of her eye and eyestrain. This lasted for a day. She also noted her blood
pressure was elevated. She was seen in emergency department and treated for
migraines. A CT scan was obtained that revealed no bleeding. An LP was
attempted and was traumatic. Currently, she has no significant headache. She
denies any neurologic changes. She denies seizures. She denies any visual
change.

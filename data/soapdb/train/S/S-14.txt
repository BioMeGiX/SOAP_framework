HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 
XXXX is a 42 y.o. right handed female with a history of R MCA coiling x 2 and clipping, SAH and headaches.
 
The patient is present for an evaluation of her headaches. She has been having headaches for 10 years. Initially, her headaches were like a pressure on the left side with no N/V, photo or phonophobia.  She was started on Topamax 25 mg tid at one point but she stopped as it did not help her. She continued to have headaches until 4 years ago when suddenly she felt a popping sound in her head. Afterwards, she developed a severe headache, neck stiffness with nausea and vomiting. She was evaluated by an OSH ED and was told that it was an exacerbation of her migraines. She did not have a CT head scan because her exam was non-focal. However, she continued to have severe headaches so she saw an OSH neurologist who recommended naproxen and prednisone. Her headaches continued, so she saw her PCP who sent her for a CTH and an MRI brain, which showed multiple heterogenously enhancing lesions. She followed up with HF neurosurgery where she had a right frontotemporal craniotomy for a brain biopsy. She was later found to have SAH from a ruptured R MCA aneurysm.
 
Since then, she had underwent endovascular coiling and then recoiling. In 02/2015, she under a right craniotomy for a R MCA aneurysm clipping after an evidence of aneurysm recanalization. She continued to be stable with no noticeable neurological deficits. She had a recent Head CT and CTA head/neck that was unchanged except for an infundibulum dilatation at the junction of the basilar artery, left superior cerebellar artery and left posterior cerebral artery. She follows up with neurosurgery regularly (last visit on 12/2016/).
 
Since her last surgery, she had developed a sharp headache in the area of the craniotomy. The pain radiates to the back of the head  with no N/V, photo or phonophobia. She denied an electrical sensation in the area. There is no weakness, numbness, diplopia, blurred vision or gait imbalance. The headache is not positional with no autonomic features. It is 9/10 and constant occurring daily. She had tried Fioricet but stopped because it did not work. She feels that Norco was the only medication that actually helped her.
 
Of note, her maternal grandmother and paternal aunt both had aneurysms.

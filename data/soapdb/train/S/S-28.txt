CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
Followup visit, complains about some cysts, concerns about a lesion in the groin, followup on chronic conditions.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
I saw in the office this 66-year-old African-American lady.  She had followed up with orthopedist for her pain in the left lower extremity.  Ultrasound and MRI were essentially negative, and quite reassuring.  X-rays prove some osteoarthritis of the knee.  She continues to follow up with orthopedist.  I encouraged her to be very active.  She tells me she is using the elliptical couple of times a week.  She started  being a caregiver for her husband who underwent knee replacement.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
XXX is a pleasant 73 y.o. male who is being seen in follow up for basilar artery aneurysm, referred by Muhammad. Patient has a known history of fusiform basilar artery aneurysm and 
cavernous angioma diagnosed in 2011 when he was being worked up for an acute R cerebellar hemorrhage. The hemorrhage was deemed secondary to HTN in the presence of the aneurysm. 
On his last visit his angiogram was reviewed where the assessment and plan was that he has a enlarging fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery. 
We discussed several treatment options for the patient. First, we can just observe the aneurysm but since the aneurysm as enlarged in size significantly in 2 years, conservative 
treatment is not the ideal option. Although the risk of rupture and SAH from these aneurysms is low, there is much higher risk for clot formation within the aneurysm due to sheer 
large size and distal embolic strokes. Second, surgical option entails trapping the aneurysm with flow reversal however, the likelihood of morbidity is high because although flow 
reversal will prevent the aneurysm from enlarging by decreasing transmural pressures, it might lead to thrombosis of perforators off the basilar artery. Another surgical option is 
bypass surgery but is likely to have limited success. Third, a stent could be placed endovascularly to span the length of aneurysm and attempt to divert flow but this is not felt 
to be a viable option by our endovascular colleagues. He has had worsening balance issues with trouble ambulating at times along with 2 episodes of confuion which were short-lived, 
30 minutes or so, and reolved spontaneously.  He also had a mechanical fall in early July at which time he was evaluated by a CT/CTA which showed that the aneurysm was still 
enlarging without any evidence of hemorrhage.

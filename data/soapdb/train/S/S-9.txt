INTERVAL HISTORY :
Today, we had the opportunity to see XXX in neurosurgery clinic.
As you know, she is a 49-year-old right-handed woman, who is referred for
evaluation of a right carotid canal calcified aneurysm. This aneurysm was
discovered incidentally after she underwent CTA and MRI. These studies were
performed, because Mrs. Lang was complaining of a 2-1/2-month history of left
ear pain and tingling in the face. She has a prior history of chronic neck
pain for the last several years. She has had previous MRIs of the cervical
spine that were unremarkable. She also had other symptoms including numbness

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Today we had the opportunity to see XXX   in neurosurgery clinic.  As you know she is a 51 y.o. female who presents with history of fibromuscular dysplasia FMD, previous 
ischemic right lateral medullary stroke , plus subsequent SAH secondary to a dissecting type left vertebral artery aneurysm s/p coiling in 2010 and then the de novo formation 
of a R PICA distal dissecting aneurysm in December of 2012.  She underwent R PICA aneurysm coil occlusion.  This exacerbated her previous lateral medullary stroke.
She continues to have facial asymmetry from stroke, mild swallowing difficulties and ataxia.  She is interested in plastic surgery and a gold weight in the eyelid to help 
with the facial palsy.

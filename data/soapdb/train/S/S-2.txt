HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
XXX is a 24 y.o. right handed female who presents for follow up with hemiplegic migraines. 
 
To recap her history; she has been having severe headaches for over 2.5 years which are always left sided, and start posteriorly radiating forward. They would last for several days. It would occur 3-4 times a month. They would be pulsatile, throbbing in nature, associated with photophobia. She has been having gradual worsening of her headaches. However on every clinic visit, she reports that they are becoming worse. They can range from being dull with periodic shooting pains and associated with photophobia, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. She initially tried Motrin or Tylenol which provide mild relief. She had an uncomplicated pregnancy and full-term birth in October 2014. Headaches were without change from October until the first week of February 2015. At that time, she began experiencing tingling and weakness on the left side of her face and arm, vomited several times, and was so dizzy and lightheaded that she fell down. These associated symptoms have since continued. Patient also symptoms of numbness and weakness on her left side prior to birth of her baby 6 months ago - always there but on occasions more prominent. She had falls due to the weakness. At times it feels like she is passing out. She presented with of loss of consciousness, headache and left sided numbness and weakness to HFH West Bloomfield ER in January 2015 and was sent home after a negative CT and was told to follow up with PCP for MRI/MRA. MRI brain and MRV normal, MRA right incidental 2mm laterally directed cavernous dilatation. She subsequently follow up with Neurosurgery who advised a 1 yr follow up MRA and no intervention. 
 
She saw Dr. Walbert in April 2015 who prescribed Imitrex and Topamax for her migraines. She took them straight for a month with no effect. She took Imitrex 50mg at onset with no change in headache. She also started topamax 25mg but this gave her a change in taste. She has been taking Norco for her headaches with no relief. Her headaches then began occuring every day since June. She then began to have intermittent associated left sided weakness and numbness, slurred speech and blurred vision with her severe headaches. These symptoms can last up to a day or 2 but not longer. The numbness and weakness start at her shoulder and over minutes gradually descend over her left arm and left leg. Headaches are also always left sided. She then stopped taking any medications. She also reports some hx of shaking followed by loss of consciousness but no work up was done for this. She was seen in clinic in September 2015 and she was diagnosed with hemiplegic migraines. Her imitrex was stopped and she was started on Verapamil 120mg daily and naprosyn as breakthrough for her headaches. Follow up MRA for her aneurysm was also ordered, which showed that aneurysm was unchanged. 
 
Since Sept 2015, she has continued to have the headaches and Verapamil has had no effect. She continues to have the left sided migratory weakness and numbness and now states that it also travels to her right side. She now reports that her spells have always consisted of left sided sudden onset weakness and numbness which can move to the right side. She now also has pain shooting up and down her arm. She often does not get the headache afterwards, but if it does occur it may be several hours later and can be on any side of her head. She also complains of shooting pains going up and down her back at times. All of her symptoms have been getting worse than before. She has missed many days of work and needed to fill paperwork out but forgot to bring it today. She also states that with some of these episodes, she may become confused and has lost consciousness several times. She now states that this has always occurred with her episodes. She does admit to being stressed, due to work and taking care of her daughter.

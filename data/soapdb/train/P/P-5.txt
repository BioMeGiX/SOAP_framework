PLAN :
Ms. XXX continues to complain of daily headaches with the associated migratory pain weakness and numbness and syncopal episodes occuring 4 days out of a week. As previously mentioned, her complaints have a different pattern from her last visit. Her symptoms are changing sides and her examination continue to have nonphysiologic signs, Â dx of hemiplegic migraine.
At this time, patient and her mother were extensively counseled about all her workup being negative and that these may be complex migraines. The component of stress was also discussed to which they agreed that her symptoms do get worse when she is stressed out. 
She says excedrin migraine helps for breakthrough so she was told, she can use that as needed but not to use any NSAID daily for more than 5 days as it can cause overuse headache. 
- Cymbalta for migraine prophylaxis increased to 40mg in 2 weeks, and if it is still ineffective try 60mg daily
- Referral to behavioural health for anxiety. 
- In regards to her chest pains, she was advised to follow up with cardiology to complete the cardionet monitoring. 


COMPLICATED MIGRAINES/SPELLS :
XXX continues to complain of daily headaches with the associated migratory pain weakness and numbness which can be unilateral or bilateral and syncopal episodes occuring 4 days out of a week. As previously mentioned, her complaints have a different pattern from her last visit. When she is asked for details, she gets easily frustrated and just says its pain and headache and passing out and that no one is helping her. She wants to have a specific diagnosis to mention to her employer and not just migraines. Her 8 hour video EEG was unremarkable and given that her symptoms are changing sides and her examination continue to have nonphysiologic signs, skeptical on her dx of hemiplegic migraine and less likely that these are seizures. 
At this time, patient and her mother were extensively counseled about all her workup being negative and that these may be complex migraines. The component of stress was also discussed to which they agreed that her symptoms do get worse when she is stressed out. 
We offered lamcital and cymbalta for migraine prevention and the doses and side effects of both medications were explained. She wanted to try Cymbalta because she did not want to do the lamictal titration. She says excedrin migraine helps for breakthrough so she was told, she can use that as needed but not to use any NSAID daily for more than 5 days as it can cause overuse headache. 
- Cymbalta for migraine prophylaxis starting at 20mg and if it is ineffective increase to 40mg in 2 weeks, and if it is still ineffective try 60mg 
- She was also given a headache diary and list of headache triggers, advised to bring on next visit. 
- Follow up in 3 months. 
- In regards to her chest pains, she was advised to follow up with cardiology to complete the cardionet monitoring.

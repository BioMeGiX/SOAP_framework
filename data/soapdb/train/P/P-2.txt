Hemiplegic migraine/ Spells :
Ms. XXX continues to complain of daily headaches with no change with the verapamil. She ran out a month ago and has not noticed a difference in her symptoms. Today, her complaints have a different pattern from her last visit. There is mention of the spells of losing consciousness and the symptoms moving to her right side as well. The headaches may or may not occur together with these spells. We will evaluate these spells with an 8 hour EEG to look for seizure like activity. However given that her symptoms are changing sides and her examination today has some nonphysiologic signs, skeptical on her dx of hemiplegic migraine. 
If EEG looks unremarkable, will continue to manage as complicated migraine with aura. We will start with acetazolamide for prevention and follow up in 3 months. If acetazolamide is ineffective, will try Lamotrigine 50mg. 
If EEG is suspicious for epileptic etiology, will pursue anti-seizure medications.

"
15,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
X is a 38-year-old woman with history of
headaches who recently had two unusual headaches. She underwent imaging that
demonstrated no evidence of bleeding. This did demonstrate though an
incidental intracranial aneurysm. This aneurysm is about 5 mm in size. This
aneurysm does have a risk of future bleeding. On a day-to-day year-to-year
basis the risk is not overly high. We feel an aneurysm in this location of
this size has less than 1% chance of bleeding per year. However she
is young and over her lifetime this can add up. We do feel that treatment
consideration is indicated. We discussed the different treatment options. We
feel the conservative option is not ideal because of her age and future risk
of hemorrhage. Different interventional or surgical approaches were
discussed. We feel an endovascular coiling would be the least invasive at
this time. We did have concerns about the geometry of the aneurysm. We
discussed the risk of technical failure stoke and bleeding. She stated
understanding and would like to pursue endovascular treatment of this
intracranial aneurysm.
Thank you very much.
Sincerely

18,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
XXÂ is a 25 y.o.Â right handed female who presents for follow up for migraines/spells. 
Â 
To recap her history; she has been having severe headaches for almost 3 years which initially started off as being left sided and started posteriorly radiating forward. They would last for several days 3-4 times a month. They would be pulsatile throbbing in nature associated with photophobia. She was having gradual worsening of her headaches. However on every clinic visit she reports that they are becoming worse and worse.Â They can range from being dull with periodic shooting pains and associated with photophobia nausea vomiting and dizziness. She initially tried Motrin or Tylenol which provide mild relief. She had an uncomplicated pregnancy and full-term birth in October 2014. Headaches were without change from October until the first week of February 2015. At that time she began experiencing tingling and weakness on the left side of her face and arm vomited several times and was so dizzy and lightheaded that she fell down. She states it feel like her body giving out on her. These associated symptoms have since continued. Patient also reported symptoms of numbness and weakness on her left side prior to birth of her baby 6 months ago - always there but on occasions more prominent. She had falls due to the weakness. At times it felt like she is passing out. She presented with of loss of consciousness headache and left sided numbness and weakness to HFH West Bloomfield ER in January 2015 and was sent home after a negative CT and was told to follow up with PCP for MRI/MRA. MRI brain and MRV were normal MRA showed a right incidental 2mm laterally directed cavernous dilatation. She subsequently follow up with Neurosurgery who advised a 1 yr follow up MRA and no intervention. 
Â 
She saw Dr. Walbert in April 2015 who prescribed Imitrex and Topamax for her migraines. She took them straight for a month with no effect. She took Imitrex 50mg at onset with no change in headache. She also started topamax 25mg but this gave her a change in taste. She then started taking Norco for her headaches with no relief. Her headaches then began occuring every day since June. She then began to have intermittent associated left sided weakness and numbness slurred speech and blurred vision with her severe headaches. These symptoms would then last up to a day or 2 but not longer. The numbness and weakness start at her shoulder and over minutes gradually descend over her left arm and left leg. Headaches are also always left sided. She then stopped taking any medications. She also reports some hx of shaking followed by loss of consciousness but no work up was done for this. She was seen in clinic in September 2015 and she was diagnosed with hemiplegic migraines. Her imitrex was stopped and she was started on Verapamil 120mg daily and naprosyn as breakthrough for her headaches. Follow up MRA for her aneurysm was also ordered which showed that aneurysm was unchanged. Since Sept 2015 she continued to have the headaches and Verapamil has had no effect. She continued to have the left sided migratory weakness and numbness and now states that it also travels to her right side. She now reports that her spells have always consisted of left sided sudden onset weakness and numbness which can move to the right side when severe. She also developed pains shooting up and down her arm. She often does not get the headache afterwards but if it does occur it may be several hours later and can be on any side of her head. She also complains of shooting pains going up and down her back at times. All of her symptoms have been getting worse than before. She missed many days of work. She also stated that with some of these episodes she may become confused and has lost consciousness several times. She now states that this has always occurred with her episodes for the past year.Â She admited to being stressed due to work and taking care of her daughter. 
She subsequently underwent an 8 hour EEG which did not show any seizures or interictal activity. She says she did not have her passing out episodes that day although later said they do occur every day. She did however had her typical unilateral headache that day. On the last visit given that her symptoms were changing sides and her examination had some nonphysiologic signs we were skeptical on her dx of hemiplegic migraine.
Â 
On today's visit she reports that she is frustrated because nobody can help her and she does not want to go to any doctor any more. Mother is with her and said she lost her job because she would fall out at work she also adds that patient is not keen on taking medications. They state they are tired of explaining all the symptoms and that nothing works for her pain. The constellation of symptoms seems to be: headache one sided pain numbness and weakness which may then travel to other side if they become very severe she then passes out for seconds. She wakes up with no confusion no urinary or bowel incontinence. On average these occur 4 times a week. She continues to have daily headaches fluctuating in severity. She also reports intermittent chest pains with palpitations for which she was seen in cardiology last year. She says they have continued and she was supposed to have cardionet monitoring however it malfunctioned and she has not returns to cardiology since then. She says her sleep is good because she is always tired. Mother says she is instantly asleep at night and goes to bed early no frequent awakenings. Patient continues to be stressed due to taking care of baby not having a job and financial burden.

21,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
 
XXX is a 51 y.o. female with history of fibromuscular dysplasia FMD previous ischemic right lateral medullary stroke  plus SAH secondary to a dissecting type left vertebral artery 
aneurysm s/p coiling in 2010 and then the de novo formation of a R PICA distal dissecting aneurysm in December of 2012.  She underwent R PICA aneurysm coil occlusion.
This exacerbated her previous lateral medullary stroke.  She continues to have facial asymmetry from stroke mild swallowing difficulties and ataxia.
She is interested in plastic surgery and a gold weight in the eyelid to help with the facial palsy.  From a neurosurgical standpoint that is ok.  
She needs tight BP control.  If she has continued diastolic hypertension consideration should be made to evaluate her renal arteries considering her FMD changes in the brain.  
Follow up MRA of the brain is indicated in November or 2013.

29,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
XXXXXXXXX is a 53-year-old woman with history of
multiple sclerosis Chiari malformation and incidental aneurysms. From the
incidental aneurysm standpoint we recommend a follow up MRA in one year. Her
very small untreated aneurysms have not changed in size and her treated
aneurysms demonstrate very small neck remnants that do not require any
significant treatment at this time. We will have to continue to follow these
and if they demonstrate significant recanalization then it would be
worthwhile to do an angiogram for possible recoiling. These findings on MRA
are unrelated to her current complaints. In terms of the Chiari malformation
I see no hydrocephalus. There seems to be good CSF space at the
foramen magnum. I don't recommend any sort of surgical intervention. In terms
of the cervical syrinx this has not increased in size and in fact looks
smaller than what it did before her surgery. I do not recommend any sort of
procedure to shunt this very small cervical syrinx."
30,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
1. Upper respiratory infection.  Symptomatic treatment discussed.  
2. Impaired glucose tolerance.  Hemoglobin A1c is 5.9.  Handout  in regard of diet discussed increase level of exercise.  She tells me she has been playing glee as exercise activity.  
3. Dyslipidemia.  LDL at goal continue Lipitor.  
4. Hypertension.  Blood pressure at goal.  Medications refilled.  Follow up in 3 months or sooner if any problems occur.

31,"INTERVAL HISTORY :

54 yo M PMH HTN HPL recurrent epistaxis since April 2014 for which workup led to discovery of aneurysm in R internal carotid (17 mm) s/p 6 coils.  Also s/p R sphenopalatine artery embolization.  Intermittent epistaxis t/o past week w/ significant bleed on Tues (""gusher"") and bleeds again Thurs and Fri.  Pt sent to HFH ED by neuro-IR Dr. Kole who wanted pt to have MRA (Port huron hosp doesn't do MRA).  Pt not acutely bleeding t/o time in ED.  Hb 14.6
 
At time of signout pt awaiting MRA and results.  Plan: if significant findings --> neurosurg to admit.  If normal --> ENT consult.
 
Afternoon course:
MRA results per neurosurgery are as expected and pt does not need to be admitted to their service.
 
Upon speaking w/ ENT pt not acutely bleeding - NTD in ED.  Do want pt to follow up soon since recurrent epistaxis and pt Hx do warrant further ENT assessment. 
 
All of this was discussed w/ pt and wife who were agreeable.  Pt given instructions to follow up with Dr. Kole 313.916.xxx and ENT clinic 313.916.xxx.  Given instructions on epistaxis. 
 
Pt was stable at time of discharge home & was given information on signs/Sx warranting medical attention. Pt verbalized understanding of and agreement with discharge plan.  All questions answered.


 54 year old male who presented with right sided epistaxis in April 2014 found to have a 17 mm aneurysm of the intracavernous right internal carotid artery s/p coiling and s/p right sphenopalatine artery embolization. Patient has been without epistaxis until several days ago when he started having intermittent right sided epistaxis and sensation of blood in his mouth/throat. Patient states his bleeding is bright red without clots and resolves spontaneously in 10 minutes. Patient denies any headache vision changes nausea vomiting focal weakness or focal sensory loss. Patient was seen in Port Huron 8/14 where CT head was negative for bleed or acute process. Patient contacted neuro-interventional radiologist who performed coiling Dr. Kole who instructed patient to have MRA head with contrast. Port Huron does not perform MRA head with contrast so patient was sent to HFH for further evaluation. He is not complaining of nosebleeds or other symptoms at this time. Patient is not on blood thinners.

33,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
Followup on chronic conditions including impaired glucose tolerance  hypertension hyperlipidemia obesity and smoking.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
I saw in the office this 64-year-old  African-American female.
1.  Patient is known to have impaired glucose tolerance.  Her diet has  improved.  She states that she started exercising 10 minutes every day on the  treadmill.  She drinks almost daily couple of drinks per day sometimes  cocktails.  This may also cause her blood sugars to increase.  Though her  hemoglobin A1c has improved now 6.2.
2.  She is known to have hypertension.  Today her blood pressure is about  the goal.  Though she states she had couple of drinks prior to coming in and  considers that is the cause of hypertension.  She checks her blood pressure  at home and finds values between 120-130s of her systolic.  She cannot  recall the values of her diastolic.  She would like to maintain the same  antihypertensive medication for now.
3.  In regards of dyslipidemia she is taking Lipitor 20 mg daily.  LDL at  goal now.
4.  Patient is smoking approximately 5-7 cigarettes per day.  We discussed  smoking cessation she seems to get ready for it.  She tried Chantix in the  past without any side effects.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
She has no headaches now no tinnitus or scotoma no  chest pain or palpitations no shortness of breath or cough no nausea or  vomiting no changes in urine or bowel habits.  All other systems are  otherwise negative not pertinent unless listed in the history of present  illness.
 
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

2. Right carotid terminus aneurysm status post coiling follows up with
Neurosurgery in that regard.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. Obesity.
5. Osteopenia on calcium and vitamin D supplementation DEXA scan was done in
2010.
6. Colonoscopy in 2010 was normal noticed only internal hemorrhoids.

surgery right foot surgery. 
 
SOCIAL HISTORY: 
Patient retired was a hairdresser she is married has one biological son that is 40 years old. She quit smoking in 
beginning of 2011.
"
34,"INTERVAL HISTORY: 
Today we had the opportunity to see 935 in clinic. As you know she has history of a giant
dissecting type petrous aneurysm. This was found incidentally. She underwent primary enterprise
stenting over 1 year ago. The hope was that the stent would provide some flow remodelling. This
also left the option of stent-assisted coiling. With the advent of the pipeline
stent we were waiting to see if we can use the more covered stent to occlude
this aneurysm. Currently the pipeline is available but this would be
off-label use for this device at this time. Right now she is doing well; she
has no significant symptoms referable to this aneurysm at this time. She
still is on aspirin to prevent any thromboembolic events. She does have
history of sixth nerve palsy since birth.
"
35,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
1. Hypertension.  Blood pressure  was at goal.    Check blood  pressure routinely keep a log goal below 130/80.  
2. Impaired glucose tolerance.   hemoglobin A1C increased HbA1C is now 6.5 diet discussed. Dietician referral.  Will limit the alcohol intake.
5. Dyslipidemia.  Liver function test fasting lipid profile will be checked diet  exercise.
 Follow up in 3 months if the tests are abnormal return sooner.
"
36,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Rectal bleeding. FOB test ws positive. Previous colonoscopy showed internal hemorrhoids.  I will refer the patient to colorectal surgeon.
 
2.  Fatigue.  We will expand our investigations to include repeat blood count iron studies TSH folic acid B12 etc.
 
3.  Urinary urgency.  She doesn't have any symptoms of urinary tract infection but I wanted to rule that out.  Though she has hematuria and I am quite concerned about this.  Urine culture is pending.  I will check renal ultrasound and we'll discuss the results of the test with next visit.
 
4.  Impaired glucose tolerance.  Hemoglobin A1c at 6.4 this is very close to diabetes.  We discussed this aspect lifestyle changes.  We'll continue to monitor.
 
5.  Hypertension.  Blood pressure is at goal.
 
The visit today was very lengthy time spent with patient more than 40 minutes today half of the time coordinating care and addressing multiple problems.  Follow up in 10 to 14 days.
"
37,"INTERVAL HISTORY:
Today we had the opportunity to see XXXX in neurosurgery clinic. As
you know she is a 53-year-old woman who underwent elective treatment of a
right posterior communicating artery aneurysm and a right internal carotid
artery terminus aneurysm in March of 2010. These aneurysms were discovered
after she was being also worked up for a Chiari malformation with a
cervicothoracic syrinx. After the aneurysms were coiled she then underwent
elective treatment for her Chiari malformation. On YYYYY she underwent a
suboccipital craniectomy for treatment of her Chiari. Since that time her
cervical syrinx has decreased in size but has not completely disappeared.
Over the years since treatment though she has had continued difficulties with
vague neurologic symptoms as well as myelopathic symptoms. She then also
developed optic neuritis and she was given the diagnosis of multiple
sclerosis. She has been undergoing treatment since. She still continues to
have difficulty with her balance and her gait. She also complains of a
pressure feeling in her head. She also describes a heaviness in her eyes. She
also complains of some visual changes. She is due to see ophthalmology in the
near future. She underwent her followup MRA of the brain and MRI of the brain
and cervical spine. The cervical spine MRA demonstrates a cervicothoracic
syrinx that has not increased in size. It in fact looks smaller than her
images from 2010. Her posterior fossa looks well decompressed. There is no
significant pressure or hydrocephalus. Her MRA demonstrates small neck
remnants at her carotid terminus in posterior communicating artery sites. She
also has very tiny middle cerebral bifurcations and dilatations that we have
been monitoring conservatively. There has been no significant increase in size of her
aneurysms

46,"Assessment and Plan:
 
is a  45 y.o. male with history of basilar aneurysm anterior communicating aneurysm and MCA aneurysm.  I recommend angiogram for intent for coiling of basilar and possible anterior
communicating artery aneurysms
â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦
As you know he is a 45 y.o. male who presents with incidental basilar apex aneurysm.  This was found as part of a work up for possible renal cell carcinoma and polycythemia.  
He had RBC in his urine.  He denies neurologic deficits.  He denies stroke seizure or headaches.


Assessment and Plan:
 
XXX is a  45 y.o. male with history of new renal mass and polycythemia.  A screening study for brain lesions was performed and demonstrated an incidental aneurysm.  His aneurysm is about 5-6 mm and is located at the basilar bifurcation.  The risk of aneursymal hemorrhage is about 1% per year.  Because of his age treatment would be favored.  An endovascular approach would be less morbid in this location.  We will order a formal MRI MRA of brain to assess the geometry of the aneurysm as well as assess the brain for tumors more precisely.  We will then call him about more detailed treatment options.

48,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :

Today we had the opportunity to see X in neurosurgery clinic.
As you know she was referred for evaluation of an intracranial aneurysm.
This aneurysm was found after she underwent a CT scan of her orbit. The CT
scan of the orbit was performed because she was having headaches behind her
left eye. Approximately six weeks ago she had a severe headache lasting six
hours. She stated the headache was focused behind her left eye and near the
orbit. She had some nausea and vomiting. This headache then dissipated. She
did well for a period of time but she has had some mild headaches for the
last six weeks. Again last Saturday she had a similar headache involving
her left eye behind the orbit. She denies any double vision or any visual
changes. She denies any changes in her sleep patterns. She denies any
changes in her diet or consumption of caffeine. She is a nonsmoker. She does
have a history of migraine headache since childhood but as of late they have
not been too frequent. She stated that when she has migraines the headaches can be severe
associated with nausea and vomiting. After her CT of the orbit she
was found to have a 5-mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm. This is
predominantly fed from the right A1. The left A1 is hypoplastic with some contribution. The
neck of the aneurysm is relatively wide. A very small carotid cavernous
dilatation was also appreciated about 2 mm in size.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
Significant for migraines but otherwise unremarkable.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Significant for cryosurgery for the cervix a recent miscarriage.

ALLERGIES:
1. Codeine.

50,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
xxxxxxxxxxx is a 42 y.o. right handed female with a history of R MCA coiling x 2 and clipping SAH and headaches.
 
The patient is here for headache management. She is s/p R MCA coiling recoiling and right craniotomy for R MCA clipping after recanalization. The clipping occurred in 2015 and since then she had developed a sharp headache in the area of the craniotomy. The headache is constant and 9/10. There is no weakness numbness diplopia blurred vision or gait imbalance. The headache is not positional with no autonomic features. It is 9/10 and constant occurring daily. She had tried Fioricet but stopped because it did not work. She feels that Norco was the only medication that actually helped her. 
 
Assessment and Plan:
 
xxxxxxxxxx most likely had developed chronic headaches s/p craniotomy. The pain occurs at the area of the craniotomy. Her current headache do not have migrainous hemicrania continua SUNCT TN or cluster headaches features. There is no N/V photo or phonophobia autonomic features or trigeminal distribution.    
 
Will obtain chem 7 and CBC w/diff as a baseline. She will be started on Cymbalta 20 mg daily for 2 weeks and will increase to 40 mg daily afterwards. She will also take Norco as needed for the pain but no more than 10 days.

She describes it  as ""eye pulling feeling"".  When she gets this discomfort she is  unable to look at the computer or at the TV.  She also describes  ""a little headache"" today that is also located around her eyes.  She was evaluated in ER for headache at that time she was  diagnosed with migraine.  She had seen the neurosurgeon who  performed the coiling of the right carotid terminus aneurysm for  this intermittent eye discomfort.  Patient is known to have left  carotid ophthalmic artery aneurysm last MRI was performed to  reassess her symptoms of eye discomfort done in October of 2012  showed that the ophthalmic artery aneurysm remains somewhat  unchanged.  She is also known to have right posterior  communicating artery aneurysm.  For these aspects she follows up  in Neurosurgery.

Assessment and Plan:
 
X is a  86 y.o. female with history of multiple medical problems who was referred for an incidental 6 mm posterior communicating artery aneurysm.  
We feel this aneurysm has about a 1 % risk of bleeding per year.  Preventive treatment would be beneficial if she has a projected 5 year survival.   
Endovascular treatment could be performed with a < 5% major complication rate.  The family will contact the office if they wish to pursue treatment 
but at this time they are leaning toward conservative management.

IMAGING/TESTING
CTH and CTA head/neck


TECHNIQUE:
  
CT Angiography of the head and neck was obtained in axial plane after
intravenous injection of 75 mL. of Isovue 300. Coronal axial and
sagittal Maximum Intensity Projection reformatted images were
obtained from the axial views for accurate evaluation of vessels in
multiple projections on an independent work station. 
  
3D Surface rendered images were also obtained in multiple projections.
  
FINDINGS:
Hypoplastic left vertebral artery. Significant streak artifact
severely limits evaluation for residual or recurrent aneurysm within
the region of the right MCA.
  
There is an infundibulum dilatation at the junction of the basilar
artery left superior cerebellar artery and left posterior cerebral

"
77,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
XXX is a pleasant 73 y.o. male who is being seen in follow up for basilar artery aneurysm referred by Muhammad. Patient has a known history of fusiform basilar artery aneurysm and 
cavernous angioma diagnosed in 2011 when he was being worked up for an acute R cerebellar hemorrhage. The hemorrhage was deemed secondary to HTN in the presence of the aneurysm. 
On his last visit his angiogram was reviewed where the assessment and plan was that he has a enlarging fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery. 
We discussed several treatment options for the patient. First we can just observe the aneurysm but since the aneurysm as enlarged in size significantly in 2 years conservative 
treatment is not the ideal option. Although the risk of rupture and SAH from these aneurysms is low there is much higher risk for clot formation within the aneurysm due to sheer 
large size and distal embolic strokes. Second surgical option entails trapping the aneurysm with flow reversal however the likelihood of morbidity is high because although flow 
reversal will prevent the aneurysm from enlarging by decreasing transmural pressures it might lead to thrombosis of perforators off the basilar artery. Another surgical option is 
bypass surgery but is likely to have limited success. Third a stent could be placed endovascularly to span the length of aneurysm and attempt to divert flow but this is not felt 
to be a viable option by our endovascular colleagues. He has had worsening balance issues with trouble ambulating at times along with 2 episodes of confuion which were short-lived 
30 minutes or so and reolved spontaneously.  He also had a mechanical fall in early July at which time he was evaluated by a CT/CTA which showed that the aneurysm was still 
enlarging without any evidence of hemorrhage.

89,"History of Present ILLNESS :
XXXÂ is a 25 y.o.Â right handed female who presents for follow up for migraines. 
Â 
To recap her history; she has been having severe headaches for almost 3 years which initially started off as being left sided and started posteriorly radiating forward. They would last for several days 3-4 times a month. They are pulsatile throbbing in nature associated with photophobia. She was having gradual worsening of her headaches. However on every clinic visit she reports that they are becoming worse and worse.Â They can range from being dull with periodic shooting pains and associated with photophobia nausea vomiting and dizziness. She initially tried Motrin or Tylenol which provide mild relief. She had an uncomplicated pregnancy and full-term birth in October 2014. Headaches were without change from October until the first week of February 2015. At that time she began experiencing tingling and weakness on the left side of her face and arm vomited several times and was so dizzy and lightheaded that she fell down. She states it feel like her body giving out on her. These associated symptoms have since continued. Patient also reported symptoms of numbness and weakness on her left side prior to birth of her baby 6 months ago - always there but on occasions more prominent. She had falls due to the weakness. At times it felt like she is passing out. She presented with of loss of consciousness headache and left sided numbness and weakness to HFH West Bloomfield ER in January 2015 and was sent home after a negative CT and was told to follow up with PCP for MRI/MRA. MRI brain and MRV were normal MRA showed a right incidental 2mm laterally directed cavernous dilatation. She subsequently follow up with Neurosurgery who advised a 1 yr follow up MRA and no intervention. 
Â 
She saw Dr. XXX in April 2015 who prescribed Imitrex and Topamax for her migraines. She took them straight for a month with no effect. She took Imitrex 50mg at onset with no change in headache. She also started topamax 25mg but this gave her a change in taste. She then started taking Norco for her headaches with no relief. Her headaches then began occuring every day since June 2015. She then began to have intermittent associated left sided weakness and numbness slurred speech and blurred vision with her severe headaches. These symptoms would then last up to a day or 2 but not longer. The numbness and weakness start at her shoulder and over minutes gradually descend over her left arm and left leg. Headaches are also always left sided. She then stopped taking any medications. She also reports some hx of shaking followed by loss of consciousness but no work up was done for this. She was seen in clinic in September 2015 and she was diagnosed with hemiplegic migraines. Her imitrex was stopped and she was started on Verapamil 120mg daily and naprosyn as breakthrough for her headaches. Follow up MRA for her aneurysm was also ordered which showed that aneurysm was unchanged. Since Sept 2015 she continued to have the headaches and Verapamil has had no effect. She continued to have the left sided migratory weakness and numbness and now states that it also travels to her right side. She then reported that her spells have always consisted of left sided sudden onset weakness and numbness which can move to the right side when severe. She also developed pains shooting up and down her arm. She often does not get the headache afterwards but if it does occur it may be several hours later and can be on any side of her head. She also complains of shooting pains going up and down her back at times. All of her symptoms have been getting worse than before. She has been on disability since February. She also stated that with some of these episodes she may become confused and has lost consciousness several times. She now states that this has always occurred with her episodes for the past year.Â She admited to being stressed due to work and taking care of her daughter. 
She subsequently underwent an 8 hour EEG which did not show any seizures or interictal activity. She says she did not have her passing out episodes that day although later said they do occur every day. She did however had her typical unilateral headache that day. On the last visit given that her symptoms were changing sides and her examination had some nonphysiologic signs we were skeptical on her dx of hemiplegic migraine.
Â 
On today's visit she reports that the cymbalta at 20mg has not worked at all for her. The constellation of symptoms seems to be: headache one sided pain numbness and weakness which is now only on the left side if they become very severe she then passes out for seconds. She wakes up with no confusion no urinary or bowel incontinence. On average these occur 4 times a week. She continues to have daily headaches fluctuating in severity. She also reports intermittent chest pains with palpitations for which she was seen in cardiology last year. These symptoms may occur prior to her passing out. She says they have continued and she was supposed to have cardionet monitoring however it malfunctioned and she has not returns to cardiology since then.

"
99,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 
XXXX is a 42 y.o. right handed female with a history of R MCA coiling x 2 and clipping SAH and headaches.
 
The patient is present for an evaluation of her headaches. She has been having headaches for 10 years. Initially her headaches were like a pressure on the left side with no N/V photo or phonophobia.  She was started on Topamax 25 mg tid at one point but she stopped as it did not help her. She continued to have headaches until 4 years ago when suddenly she felt a popping sound in her head. Afterwards she developed a severe headache neck stiffness with nausea and vomiting. She was evaluated by an OSH ED and was told that it was an exacerbation of her migraines. She did not have a CT head scan because her exam was non-focal. However she continued to have severe headaches so she saw an OSH neurologist who recommended naproxen and prednisone. Her headaches continued so she saw her PCP who sent her for a CTH and an MRI brain which showed multiple heterogenously enhancing lesions. She followed up with HF neurosurgery where she had a right frontotemporal craniotomy for a brain biopsy. She was later found to have SAH from a ruptured R MCA aneurysm.
 
Since then she had underwent endovascular coiling and then recoiling. In 02/2015 she under a right craniotomy for a R MCA aneurysm clipping after an evidence of aneurysm recanalization. She continued to be stable with no noticeable neurological deficits. She had a recent Head CT and CTA head/neck that was unchanged except for an infundibulum dilatation at the junction of the basilar artery left superior cerebellar artery and left posterior cerebral artery. She follows up with neurosurgery regularly (last visit on 12/2016/).
 
Since her last surgery she had developed a sharp headache in the area of the craniotomy. The pain radiates to the back of the head  with no N/V photo or phonophobia. She denied an electrical sensation in the area. There is no weakness numbness diplopia blurred vision or gait imbalance. The headache is not positional with no autonomic features. It is 9/10 and constant occurring daily. She had tried Fioricet but stopped because it did not work. She feels that Norco was the only medication that actually helped her.
 
Of note her maternal grandmother and paternal aunt both had aneurysms.

Conditions/Diagnoses that complicated treatment/Significant Procedures:
Hospital Course dictation pending.
Hospital Course (Dictated):

This is a 48-year-old female who presented to the ER at an outside
hospital in stuporous state. Head CT there showed subarachnoid
hemorrhage and hydrocephalus. She was transferred to Henry Ford from
emergency room for a neurosurgical evaluation. Upon admission she
immediately received a head CT. She was eyes open spontaneously able
to barely say her name and able to localize with symmetrical strength.
An EVD was placed emergently in the operating room. CSF was under
pressure. A CT angio was also obtained at that time it demonstrated a
left PICA aneurysm. She was taken back to the interventional
angiography suite for angiogram and during that procedure we were able
to successfully coil the left PICA aneurysm. After the procedure the
patient was managed in the neuro intensive care unit. Postprocedure
imaging head CT for routine followup showed that the patient had a
hypodensity in the left cerebellum in the distribution of the left
superior cerebellar artery. This was deemed to be secondary to embolic
emboli from the procedure. On clinical exam she had very mild leftsided
cerebellar dysfunction. It should be noted that the patient had
a prior CVA in which she had baseline right-sided facial droop. She
remained in the intensive care unit for EVD drainage and also for
vasospasm watch. She did not have vasospasm to the level that required
any sort of interventional procedure. She did well her exam remained
stable. By the end of the 14 days in the intensive care unit the
patient's external ventricular drain was able to be discontinued. The
patient was transferred to the GPU. Physical therapy saw the patient
they recommended discharge home. The patient was discharged with a
neurological exam that showed a right facial droop which was chronic
and some mild left-sided cerebellar deficits but other than that she
was neurologically intact. She was in good medical condition and she
has instructions to follow up in the neurosurgery clinic.

"
108,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
XXXÂ is a 24 y.o.Â right handed female who presents for follow up with hemiplegic migraines. 
Â 
To recap her history; she has been having severe headaches for over 2.5 years which are always left sided and start posteriorly radiating forward. They would last for several days. It would occur 3-4 times a month. They would be pulsatile throbbing in nature associated with photophobia. She has been having gradual worsening of her headaches. However on every clinic visit she reports that they are becoming worse. They can range from being dull with periodic shooting pains and associated with photophobia nausea vomiting and dizziness. She initially tried Motrin or Tylenol which provide mild relief. She had an uncomplicated pregnancy and full-term birth in October 2014. Headaches were without change from October until the first week of February 2015. At that time she began experiencing tingling and weakness on the left side of her face and arm vomited several times and was so dizzy and lightheaded that she fell down. These associated symptoms have since continued. Patient also symptoms of numbness and weakness on her left side prior to birth of her baby 6 months ago - always there but on occasions more prominent. She had falls due to the weakness. At times it feels like she is passing out. She presented with of loss of consciousness headache and left sided numbness and weakness to HFH West Bloomfield ER in January 2015 and was sent home after a negative CT and was told to follow up with PCP for MRI/MRA. MRI brain and MRV normal MRA right incidental 2mm laterally directed cavernous dilatation. She subsequently follow up with Neurosurgery who advised a 1 yr follow up MRA and no intervention. 
Â 
She saw Dr. Walbert in April 2015 who prescribed Imitrex and Topamax for her migraines. She took them straight for a month with no effect. She took Imitrex 50mg at onset with no change in headache. She also started topamax 25mg but this gave her a change in taste. She has been taking Norco for her headaches with no relief. Her headaches then began occuring every day since June. She then began to have intermittent associated left sided weakness and numbness slurred speech and blurred vision with her severe headaches. These symptoms can last up to a day or 2 but not longer. The numbness and weakness start at her shoulder and over minutes gradually descend over her left arm and left leg. Headaches are also always left sided. She then stopped taking any medications. She also reports some hx of shaking followed by loss of consciousness but no work up was done for this. She was seen in clinic in September 2015 and she was diagnosed with hemiplegic migraines. Her imitrex was stopped and she was started on Verapamil 120mg daily and naprosyn as breakthrough for her headaches. Follow up MRA for her aneurysm was also ordered which showed that aneurysm was unchanged. 
Â 
Since Sept 2015 she has continued to have the headaches and Verapamil has had no effect. She continues to have the left sided migratory weakness and numbness and now states that it also travels to her right side. She now reports that her spells have always consisted of left sided sudden onset weakness and numbness which can move to the right side. She now also has pain shooting up and down her arm. She often does not get the headache afterwards but if it does occur it may be several hours later and can be on any side of her head. She also complains of shooting pains going up and down her back at times. All of her symptoms have been getting worse than before. She has missed many days of work and needed to fill paperwork out but forgot to bring it today. She also states that with some of these episodes she may become confused and has lost consciousness several times. She now states that this has always occurred with her episodes. She does admit to being stressed due to work and taking care of her daughter.

REVIEW OF IMAGING :
MRI brain in 2015 was unremarkable.
Most recent CTA head and neck Feb 2017: 2 mm aneurysm arising laterally from the cavernous segment of the
right internal carotid artery. Overall appearance is similar to the prior MRA examinations.





"
112,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
X is status post treatment of an incidental
aneurysm. She does have two very small incidental aneurysms that are
unsecured. We do recommend an MRI of the brain as well as MRA post coil
protocol to monitor her treated right carotid terminus aneurysm and check her
very small right posterior communicating artery lesion and left carotid
ophthalmic artery aneurysm.
"
113,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
Followup on chronic conditions 
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
I saw in the office this 63-year-old  African-American female. Patient feels quite well now. She declines recent headaches. She had labs done recently  HbA1C was 6.5 LDL at goal.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
Declines recent headaches..  She has no chest pain or palpitations  no shortness of breath or cough no nausea or vomiting no  changes in urine or bowel habits.  She is quite anxious.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Impaired glucose tolerance.
1. Hypertension.
2. Right carotid terminus aneurysm status post coiling follows up with
Neurosurgery in that regard.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. Obesity.
5. Osteopenia on calcium and vitamin D supplementation DEXA scan was done in
2010.
6. Colonoscopy in 2010 was normal noticed only internal hemorrhoids.
7. Right knee osteoarthritis status post intraarticular joint injection.
8. Degenerative joint disease in lumbosacral spine with facet arthritis.
9. Genital herpes.

surgery right foot surgery. 
 
SOCIAL HISTORY: 
Patient will retire this year she works as a hairdresser she is 
married has one biological son that is 40 years old. She quit smoking in beginning of 2011.
"
114,"ED COURSE:
MDM
Number of Diagnoses or Management Options
Epistaxis: established and worsening
Right internal carotid artery aneurysm: established and worsening
Diagnosis management comments: Patient to receive MRA head with contrast. Procedure delayed as radiology needed to confirm that aneursym coil make/model is compatible with MRI machine. Note writer found coil specifications under ""Patient Images > XA Vessels 04//2014 > Report > Materials Utilized"" which confirms that coil is indeed appropriate for MRA. Neurosurgery consulted and are aware of patient. If abnormal MRA then neurosurgery likely to admit. If negative MRA then ENT to be consulted. No active bleeding or neurologic symptoms at this time. Sign out given to Jessica Everett MD.
"
115,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
This is a 49-year-old woman with history of right petrous
carotid canal aneurysm. We do recommend an angiogram to further define this
lesion. It is in a relatively unusual location but has a low risk of
future bleeding. It is also below the cavernous sinus and so compression of
cranial nerves are unlikely. She could have thromboembolic events from this
aneurysm. A baby aspirin may be helpful to prevent future thromboembolic
events. This aneurysm is probably unrelated though to her recent symptoms.
An angiogram may be helpful to rule out remote possibility of a dissection
causing left-sided face pain. We will also refer her to neuroophthalmology
to evaluate her chronic bilateral sixth nerve palsies. After the angiogram
we can determine whether future treatment is warranted or possible.
"
116,"PLAN:
- Naprosyn 500 mg for the migraine attacks to be taken within 30 minutes.
- verapamil 120 mg CR daily for preventative therapy.
- follow up in 3 months

 "
117,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
Cheryl Lang has a history of giant petrous aneurysm.
Currently she is doing well. We do recommend MRI/MRA to assess the aneurysm
the blood vessel and if there has been any interval thromboembolic events.
We also discussed pipeline stent and at this time DrXX at yyy
Hospital is the only one that has access to this stent in the Michigan area.
We offered to give a referral to him to discuss the use of this stent in this
case. We also discussed stent-assisted coiling options as well as trapping
and bypass options. At this time she is not interested in pursuing the stent
coiling or the bypass options. We tend to agree that these do have a much
higher risk of morbidity and mortality.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
I saw in the office this 66-year-old African-American lady.  She had followed up with orthopedist for her pain in the left lower extremity.  Ultrasound and MRI were essentially negative and quite reassuring.  X-rays prove some osteoarthritis of the knee.  She continues to follow up with orthopedist.  I encouraged her to be very active.  She tells me she is using the elliptical couple of times a week.  She started  being a caregiver for her husband who underwent knee replacement.
 
 
She has a history of herpes and she was concerned that the small lesion in the inguinal area noted to be outbreak.  She seems to be doing better.  She is feeling better.  She is starting to exercise more regularly.

120,"INTERVAL HISTORY :

54 yo M PMH HTN HPL recurrent epistaxis since April 2014 for which workup led to discovery of aneurysm in R internal carotid (17 mm) s/p 6 coils.  Also s/p R sphenopalatine artery embolization.  Intermittent epistaxis t/o past week w/ significant bleed on Tues (""gusher"") and bleeds again Thurs and Fri.  Pt sent to HFH ED by neuro-IR Dr. Kole who wanted pt to have MRA (Port huron hosp doesn't do MRA).  Pt not acutely bleeding t/o time in ED.  Hb 14.6
 
At time of signout pt awaiting MRA and results.  Plan: if significant findings --> neurosurg to admit.  If normal --> ENT consult.
 
Afternoon course:
MRA results per neurosurgery are as expected and pt does not need to be admitted to their service.
 
Upon speaking w/ ENT pt not acutely bleeding - NTD in ED.  Do want pt to follow up soon since recurrent epistaxis and pt Hx do warrant further ENT assessment. 
 
All of this was discussed w/ pt and wife who were agreeable.  Pt given instructions to follow up with Dr. Kole 313.916.xxx and ENT clinic 313.916.xxx.  Given instructions on epistaxis. 
 
Pt was stable at time of discharge home & was given information on signs/Sx warranting medical attention. Pt verbalized understanding of and agreement with discharge plan.  All questions answered.


 54 year old male who presented with right sided epistaxis in April 2014 found to have a 17 mm aneurysm of the intracavernous right internal carotid artery s/p coiling and s/p right sphenopalatine artery embolization. Patient has been without epistaxis until several days ago when he started having intermittent right sided epistaxis and sensation of blood in his mouth/throat. Patient states his bleeding is bright red without clots and resolves spontaneously in 10 minutes. Patient denies any headache vision changes nausea vomiting focal weakness or focal sensory loss. Patient was seen in Port Huron 8/14 where CT head was negative for bleed or acute process. Patient contacted neuro-interventional radiologist who performed coiling Dr. Kole who instructed patient to have MRA head with contrast. Port Huron does not perform MRA head with contrast so patient was sent to HFH for further evaluation. He is not complaining of nosebleeds or other symptoms at this time. Patient is not on blood thinners.

123,"INTERVAL HISTORY :
Today we had the opportunity to see XXX in neurosurgery clinic.
As you know she is a 49-year-old right-handed woman who is referred for
evaluation of a right carotid canal calcified aneurysm. This aneurysm was
discovered incidentally after she underwent CTA and MRI. These studies were
performed because Mrs. Lang was complaining of a 2-1/2-month history of left
ear pain and tingling in the face. She has a prior history of chronic neck
pain for the last several years. She has had previous MRIs of the cervical
spine that were unremarkable. She also had other symptoms including numbness
on the left side of the body and some balance difficulty. Currently she has
no significant balance difficulty. She denies history of prior stroke or
seizure. She denies any recent trauma. She did have a motor vehicle accident
26 years ago without significant hospitalization or injuries. She has had
prior perforation of the left tympanic membrane after an airline flight. She
denies any recent middle ear problems or infections.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
Significant for motor vehicle accident 26 years ago

125,"Hemiplegic migraine/ Spells :
Ms. XXX continues to complain of daily headaches with no change with the verapamil. She ran out a month ago and has not noticed a difference in her symptoms. Today her complaints have a different pattern from her last visit. There is mention of the spells of losing consciousness and the symptoms moving to her right side as well. The headaches may or may not occur together with these spells. We will evaluate these spells with an 8 hour EEG to look for seizure like activity. However given that her symptoms are changing sides and her examination today has some nonphysiologic signs skeptical on her dx of hemiplegic migraine. 
If EEG looks unremarkable will continue to manage as complicated migraine with aura. We will start with acetazolamide for prevention and follow up in 3 months. If acetazolamide is ineffective will try Lamotrigine 50mg. 
If EEG is suspicious for epileptic etiology will pursue anti-seizure medications. "

129,"PLAN :
Ms. XXX continues to complain of daily headaches with the associated migratory pain weakness and numbness and syncopal episodes occuring 4 days out of a week. As previously mentioned her complaints have a different pattern from her last visit. Her symptoms are changing sides and her examination continue to have nonphysiologic signs Â dx of hemiplegic migraine.
At this time patient and her mother were extensively counseled about all her workup being negative and that these may be complex migraines. The component of stress was also discussed to which they agreed that her symptoms do get worse when she is stressed out. 
She says excedrin migraine helps for breakthrough so she was told she can use that as needed but not to use any NSAID daily for more than 5 days as it can cause overuse headache. 
- Cymbalta for migraine prophylaxis increased to 40mg in 2 weeks and if it is still ineffective try 60mg daily
- Referral to behavioural health for anxiety. 
- In regards to her chest pains she was advised to follow up with cardiology to complete the cardionet monitoring. 


COMPLICATED MIGRAINES/SPELLS :
XXX continues to complain of daily headaches with the associated migratory pain weakness and numbness which can be unilateral or bilateral and syncopal episodes occuring 4 days out of a week. As previously mentioned her complaints have a different pattern from her last visit. When she is asked for details she gets easily frustrated and just says its pain and headache and passing out and that no one is helping her. She wants to have a specific diagnosis to mention to her employer and not just migraines. Her 8 hour video EEG was unremarkable and given that her symptoms are changing sides and her examination continue to have nonphysiologic signs skeptical on her dx of hemiplegic migraine and less likely that these are seizures. 
At this time patient and her mother were extensively counseled about all her workup being negative and that these may be complex migraines. The component of stress was also discussed to which they agreed that her symptoms do get worse when she is stressed out. 
We offered lamcital and cymbalta for migraine prevention and the doses and side effects of both medications were explained. She wanted to try Cymbalta because she did not want to do the lamictal titration. She says excedrin migraine helps for breakthrough so she was told she can use that as needed but not to use any NSAID daily for more than 5 days as it can cause overuse headache. 
- Cymbalta for migraine prophylaxis starting at 20mg and if it is ineffective increase to 40mg in 2 weeks and if it is still ineffective try 60mg 
- She was also given a headache diary and list of headache triggers advised to bring on next visit. 
- Follow up in 3 months. 
- In regards to her chest pains she was advised to follow up with cardiology to complete the cardionet monitoring."
130,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. Right hip pain due to osteoarthritis.  She would benefit from physical therapy but she declines it she already went through it.  We will refer to orthopedist.
2. Left lower extremity pain which seems positional with compression of the nerve resembling meralgia paresthetica on the left.  She will discuss this aspect with orthopedist also.  She would benefit from physical therapy gentle massage adjustment of the positions etc.
3. Rectal bleeding.  She is known to have internal hemorrhoids but she has had bleeding recently she tells me quite often and appears to be large the toilet seems to have large amount of blood.  We will check CBC.  We will check also coags.  Emergent referral to Colorectal Surgery was given.
4. Ecchymosis.  Non-observed today.  We will check CBC anemia studies and PT PTT INR and platelets count.  She should follow up in the office in 1-2 weeks given the multitude of problems addressed.

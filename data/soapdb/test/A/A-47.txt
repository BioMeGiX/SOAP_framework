HOSPITAL COURSE:
 	
54 year old female patient with a past medical history of anxiety, depression, back pain, vitamin D deficiency, HTN, herpes, substance abuse, hydrocephalus, SAH from ruptured right P-comm aneurysm s/p coiling on 9/X/2013 who presented to the Henry Ford Hospital Emergency Department on 10/X/17 with complaints of headache and vision disturbances.
 
Patient s/p coiling for a ruptured P-comm aneurysm on 9/X/13 and subsequently developed a residual aneurysm neck. Patient underwent placement of a PED in the right ICA across the P-comm residual on 10/X/17. Patient was discharged on aspirin and plavix for the stent at that time. Patient stated that a few hours after taking her aspirin and plavix on 10/X/17 she developed acute headache and had difficulty with her vision.  She denied weakness, sensory abnormalities.
 
 Head CT done in the ED on 10/X/17 was read as: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered within the right temporal occipital lobe. A small amount of subdural hemorrhage is seen along the tentorium and falx. There is adjacent vasogenic edema with mild local mass effect. No midline shift or evidence of herniation.
 
Patient was admitted to the Neurosurgical ICU for monitoring and neuro checks.  Patient had a CTA of the head and neck done on 10/X/17 which was read as: In the region of the posterior temporal occipital lobe hematoma on the right, no dilated arteries or veins are identified. No dural venous sinus thrombosis is seen, a distal right internal carotid artery stent and endovascular coils within a coiled P-comm aneurysm. The stent is patent and no definitive recurrence of the neck of the aneurysm is identified with limitations because of the intense spray artifact, uplicated proximal right vertebral artery which is a congenital variation, and no new tight stenosis or thrombosis is seen.  
 
A left lower extremity venous doppler study done on 10/X/17 showed no evidence of acute deep vein thrombosis of the left lower extremity.  
 
Repeat follow up Head CT done on 10/X/17 was read as: The morphology of the right parieto-occipital hemorrhage is similar to prior study, although now there is hemorrhage seen in the dependent portion of the left lateral ventricle. No hydrocephalus or new hemorrhage has developed. No midline shift is seen.
 
MRI of the brain done on 10/X/17 and read as: A large right parietal occipital hematoma with surrounding vasogenic edema, mass effect on the atrium and right occipital horn. There is local sulcal effacement and some shift which approaches the
midline without hydrocephalus.  There is intraventricular hemorrhage, small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage and a right small subdural hematoma seen related to
extension of the aforementioned hematoma.  Susceptibility weighted images demonstrate superficial siderosis involving the cerebellar folia, greatest involving the upper vermis. There is also an area of hemosiderin staining involving the left parietal cortex. This may relate to prior episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Chronic ischemic white matter change without evidence for acute infarct.
 
Patient was evaluated by Dr. Max Kole, Neurosurgery and it was decided that no Neurosurgical intervention was indicated.  Patient was evaluated by the Hematology consult service on 10/X/17 and it was recommended that patient be started on dual anti-platelet therapy with Plavix 75mg po every other day and daily ASA 81mg, with a goal of achieving daily Plavix therapy as tolerated by the patient.  Dr. Kole agreed with the Hematology recommendations and cleared patient on 10/X/17 to begin taking ASA 81mg daily and Plavix 75mg every other day due to stent thrombosis risk.  
 
Patient was evaluated by PT/OT and it was recommended that patient be discharged home with outpatient vision rehab.  A RX for vision rehab was provided to patient at discharge.  Patient was tolerating an oral diet at time of discharge.  She was cleared on 10/X/17 for discharge home by Dr. Kole.  Patient was discharged home on 10/X/17 and will follow up with Dr. Kole on 11/X/17 at 1:30pm in the K-11 Neurosurgery Clinic.
